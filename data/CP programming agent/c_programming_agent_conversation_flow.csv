Step	Prompt	Response	Next step	
1	Write a code that implements for loop in C to dispay the numbers between 1 and 10	"for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf(""%d"", i);
}"	2	
1		(int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {	1.1	You don't seem to have written the for loop properly
1		"for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++); {
    printf(""%d"", i);
}"	1.3	You seem to have a little problem in your code
1.1		"for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
}"	1.2	Your solution seems to be incomplete
1.2	Can you indetiy the part of the code that is missing	I did not include the printf() statement to display the output	1.2.1	
		I think my code is right	1.2.2	Your seem to be missing something that the question requires
1.2.1	Can you read the question again and indetify which aspect of the question you did not implement	"Okay, I think I missed the part for displaying the output"	1.2.1.1	
1.2.1.1	Now complete the code	"for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf(""%d"", i);
}"	2	
				
1.3	Can you indetify where the error is	I can't seem to find the error	1.4	
		I placed a semicolon at the end of the defination of the loop	1.5	
1.4				
1.5	Can you re write the code correcting the previous mistake	"for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
    printf(""%d"", i);
}"		
				
2	Use the for loop to display a sequence of numbers between 1 and 10 with a step of two between the numbers
