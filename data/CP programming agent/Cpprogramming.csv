get started,Welcome to the programming chatbot,1.,Get started with for loop,1.3.,1.3.
I can write a loop in C,I am glad you know how to write a loop. Can you write a loop to displays numbers 1 to 10 [1.3.],1.,Get started with for loop,1.3.,1.1.
I don't know anything about loops,"OK let’s lets start by learning about variables, one of the building blocks of loops. Can you define a variable that will store number 5 [1.2.]",1.,Get started with for loop,1.2.,1.2.
I know what loops do,"Great, can you tell me what loops do?[1.1.1.]",1.,Get started with for loop,1.1.1.,1.1.2.
loops help in repeating things in your code,"That is correct, thats exactly what they are. Write for me the syntax of a for loop. [1.1.2.]",1.1.1.,for loop,1.1.2.,1.1.1.1.
I think they help in reducing the amount of code I write,"That is correct, thats exactly what they are. Write for me the syntax of a for loop. [1.1.2.]",1.1.,Loop function,1.1.1.1.,1.1.1.2.
int a =5,"Good attempt, You missed a semi colon at the end of the statement, all statements in C have to end with a semi colon. Correct your code and submit again",1.2.,variable defination,1.1.,1.1.
"The syntax for the for loop is
for(intialization;condition;increment)
{
      //what is to be reapeted
}","That is correct,how do you write the initialization part of the loop if the loop was to start from 1?",1.1.2.,Loop defination,1.1.1.2.,1.3.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}","Your code is correct, can you now write a loop that only displays number even numbers",1.3.,printing 1 to 10,1.4.,1.4.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1,i<=10,i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}","Your code seems to have a problem at the loop defination, can you check to see if you can spot the error",1.1.,for loop,1.2.1,1.2.1.
i=1,"That is correct, now write the condition part of the loop for a loop that will have to display numbers from 1 to 10",1.1.2.,Loop defination,1.1.2.,
I cannot see the error,"Okay, what symbols do you use to separate statements in the loop",1.1.2.,,,
