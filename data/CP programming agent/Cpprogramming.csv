I can write a loop in C,"I'm glad you're interested in learning about for loops in C. They're a key concept in C programming, and I'm here to help you understand them better based on your current knowledge. To get started, could you share what you already know about for loops in C programming?",1.,implementation,1.3.,1.1.
I don't know anything about loops,"OK let’s lets start by learning about variables, one of the building blocks of loops. Can you define a variable that will store number 5 ",1.,initilization,1.2.,1.2.
I know what loops do,"Great, can you tell me what loops do?",1.,defination,1.1.1.,1.1.2.
loops help in repeating things in your code,That's right; you've got it! Could you write out the syntax of a for loop in C programmingfor me?,1.1.1.,defination,1.1.2.,1.1.1.1.
I think they help in reducing the amount of code I write,"That is correct, thats exactly what they are. Write for me the syntax of a for loop.",1.1.,defination,1.1.1.1.,1.1.1.2.
int a =5,"Good attempt, You missed a semi colon at the end of the statement, all statements in C have to end with a semi colon. Correct your code and submit again",1.2.,intialization,1.1.,1.1.
"The syntax for the for loop is
for(intialization;condition;increment)
{
      //what is to be reapeted
}","That is correct,how do you write the initialization part of the loop if the loop was to start from 1?",1.1.2.,defination,1.1.1.2.,1.3.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}","Your code is correct, can you now write a loop that only displays number even numbers",1.3.,implementation,1.4.,1.4.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1,i<=10,i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}","Your code seems to have a problem at the loop defination, can you check to see if you can spot the error",1.1.,implementation,1.2.1,1.2.1.
i=1,"That is correct, now write the condition part of the loop for a loop that will have to display numbers from 1 to 10",1.1.2.,initilization,1.1.2.,
I cannot see the error,"Okay, what symbols do you use to separate statements in the loop",1.1.2.,,,
