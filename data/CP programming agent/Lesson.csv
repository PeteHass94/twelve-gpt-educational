I can write a loop in C	Tell the user you are really happy they know so much. Ask the user too write a loop for displaying numbers 1 to 10.	1.0	Get started with for loop	1.1.
I don't know anything about loops	OK let’s help the user learn about variables first. Ask the user if they can you define a variable for you?	1.0	Get started with for loop	1.2.
loops help in repeating things in your code	"Tell the user that they are right, thats exactly what they are. Now ask if they know why loops are important"	1.0	for loop	1.1.2.
"   for(i=1,i<=10,i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }"	"Check the code submitted by the user. If there are errors point out the error, if there are no errors ask the user to write a loop that prints numbers 1 to 10 but skips number 5"	1.1.	Loop function	1.1.1.
"The syntax for the for loop is
for(intialization;condition;increment)
{
      //what is to be reapeted
}"	"Check whether the user has written the right syntax, if it is right, congragulate the user and ask them to write a for loop to display the numbers 1 to 10"	1.1.	Loop defination	1.1.1.2.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}"	Check the code to see if it does write out the numbers 1 to 10. If you think it does then congratulate them on their great coding. Now ask them to copy the code into code runner and check it. Otherwise tell them where you think the error is in their code and ask them to try again.	1.1.	printing 1 to 10	1.1.
"#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int i;
    for(i=1,i<=10,i++)
    {
        printf(""%d "",i);

    }
}"	"Check the code to see if it does write out the numbers 1 to 10. It looks like the user has used , instead of ; to separate the variables. Tell them to check that they have got it right and try again."	1.1.	for loop	1.2.1.
