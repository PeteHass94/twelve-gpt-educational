God Exists

1. Thesis:
The God of classical monotheism (omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent mind) exists.

  1.1. Pro:
  There are sound arguments for God.

    1.1.1. Pro:
    Free Will exists, and Free Will cannot be generated by a cause that does not possess Free Will. Therefore, a cause with Free Will must always have existed. This is God

      1.1.1.1. Pro:
      Free will is non-deterministic order. Deterministic systems produce only deterministic things, and random systems produce only randomness. Therefore, non-deterministic order cannot be the product of deterministic order or randomness, so it can only be the product of another instance of non-deterministic order.

        1.1.1.1.1. Con:
        Randomness can cause order and be predictable at scale. Statistics is the study of that.

          1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
          Randomness is the quality or state of lacking a pattern or principle of organization; unpredictability. A descriptive quality or state doesn’t cause anything to happen much less exist.

        1.1.1.1.2. Con:
        Free will is deterministic. It seems non-deterministic because it's so complex of a system that we, today, don't have the ability to compute it entirely. What we see as random results are results that are unpredictable, but which do come from a complex deterministic system.

        1.1.1.1.3. Con:
        Free will is actually deterministic. We are free to exercise choices which are influenced by our experiences, upbringing, values, education, beliefs, biological drives, society and desires. The fact that a person's choices are predictable makes free will deterministic.

          1.1.1.1.3.1. Con:
          Predictability and Determinism are distinct and separate things. The assumption that they are the same begs the question.

            1.1.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
            Determinism is not assumed to be the same as predictability. Predictability is a consequence of determinism.

      1.1.1.2. Con:
      Free will is an illusion. With a sufficient understanding of the human brain, the decisions humans make can be predicted. Free will is simply an emergent property of a complex system.

        1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
        Researchers have been able to predict simple and deliberate decisions participants in fMRI scanners will make before the participant is aware they have made up their mind. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [1]
        This means (a) decisions appear in the material brain and (b) this precedes conscious awareness.

        1.1.1.2.2. Con:
        If the soul exists, volition is a faculty of the soul, not the body.

          1.1.1.2.2.1. Pro:
          The human soul [2] (mind) exists.

            1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
            The existence of the human brain is evidence against the supernatural because it is unclear why souls require brains.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
              It is an unwarranted assumption to conclude that a simple transceiver would suffice in place of a brain for a soul to interact with the physical world because there would be nothing in place to interpret the commands.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                If the soul was the mind and the seat of consciousness then the only thing the brain would need to do would be receive information from the soul, decode it, and send it to the rest of the body. The same is true in the reverse direction it would need to receive the senses encode them and send them to the soul. In reality though the brain is a processing unit filled with neural networks that process information themselves without the need to outsource the computing to a soul.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The brain may be all the body needs to process physical stimuli; however, the soul is not claimed to conduct these functions for a person but to rather process non-physical stimuli.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Transceivers only send and receive signals. Something must exist to interpret and execute those signals. Even simple RC cars [3] use complex circuit boards to execute a received command.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3. Pro:
                A signal can be sent to a device. That device can even receive that signal. But without something else to turn that signal into action (e.g. a processor), nothing would happen.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2. Con:
              Souls existing in their own right does not impede brains from existing. Existence is not perfectly efficient.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
                In the abstract, existence is not efficient, but in living creatures, evolution is a relentless seeker of efficiency. If the soul makes parts of the brain redundant, then those parts of the brain should have been sanded off by natural selection eons ago.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.1.3. Pro:
              On supernaturalism, minds could exist in their own right as an immaterial (or substance-dual) soul. If souls could fulfill the brain's function, we would have no need of brains that take 1/5th of the body's energy. A simple transceiver would suffice.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.3.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2. Con:
                Strawman: It is not claimed that a soul can fulfill the brain's functions. The claim is that the soul needs to animate a physical body to interact with the physical world.

            1.1.1.2.2.1.2. Pro:
            Billions of people across time and physical locations have claimed to have an experience involving the spiritual world. This, at bare minimum, makes it possible that immaterial entities exist.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1. Con:
              The experience does not vindicate or support the explanation the person assumes.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                The experience could be an incorrigible truth [4] that can't be expressed to others in terms they can understand until they experience it for themselves.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  Without doubting the truth of the experience, one can still discard the explanation.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    If the set of spiritual experiences was small, then it would be more warranted to believe that these spritual experiences weren’t possible. However, we have billions of people testifying to these experiences. Such a large set drastically increases the probability that there can be authentic expreiences with a spiritual world. Thus, it is possible (if not probable) that the spiritual world exists.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.2. Con:
              Culturally specific explanations assigned to these experiences suggests the explanations are not verified by the experience.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
                It is likely that cultural explanations do explain some or even many of these religious experiences. However, to assume this was necessarily true for all would be an unwarranted assumption.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3. Con:
              Non religious people have similar experiences without a God based explanation.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1. Con:
                This assumes the experiences of non-religious people are similar to those who believe in the spiritual based on experience. This is an unwarranted assumption.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1. Con:
                  No true Scotsman fallacy/special pleading. The descriptions are so similar that there is no reason to think they are different. All the ancient religions have spiritual experiences, as do most modern cults. The only difference is cultural interpretation.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                    **Non-Christian religious experience isn’t simply spurious. It may well be the case that adherents of other religions do enjoy a veridical experience of God as the Ground of Being on whom we creatures are dependent or as the Moral Absolute from whom values derive or even as the loving Father of mankind.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                      Without a definitive and objective way to distinguish between a spurious claim and a genuine godly experience the grandparent claim of using the no true Scotsman fallacy holds. The parent claim still suggests that some supposed godly experiences are real and others are false without presenting an objective way to distinguish them.

                        1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        This whole chain is about establishing personal warrant for believing in God. Therefore, the parent fails to distinguish between epistemological and metaphysical claims. There is a difference between knowing something to be true and showing something to be true. The primary purpose of these claims is to demonstrate that belief in God is rational and there is no epistemological objection to that can dismiss it.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.2. Con:
                    **In fact, non-Christian religious experience, such as Buddhist or Hindu religious experience, is typically very different from Christian experience. There is no reason to think that non-veridical religious experiences are indistinguishable from the witness of the Holy Spirit.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.2.1. Con:
                      What would distinguish them and who decides what distinctions truly matter? It would seem that ascribing some of these experiences as real and some as false is an entirely subjective activity. Additionally they might say the very same thing about your experience.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.2. Con:
                Religious experiences (even false ones) aren't simply spurious. It may well be the case that theists (or even non-theists) of all kinds do enjoy a veridical experience of God as the Ground of Being on whom we creatures are dependent or as the Moral Absolute from whom values derive or even as the loving Father of mankind.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4. Con:
              There are neurological or natural explanations of such experiences, which can be directly explored. m.huffpost.com [5]

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1. Pro:
                Theists' "god-detection" sense is prone to so many false positives that it's useless as a test.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1. Con:
                  Even if this is true for some individuals, it doesn’t follow that it is true for all personal experiences of God.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
                    Any alleged personal experience of God is more simply explained or interpreted in a way that does not imply the existence of a God or other supernatural entity. That is, it can be explained or interpreted in a naturalistic way. As a natural explanation/interpretation is always simpler (assumes less) than a supernatural explanation/interpretation, such an experience cannot serve as a reason to believe the supernatural.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      Experiences of awe or wonder can be simply natural experiences of awe or wonder: they need not be supernatural in origin or implication.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                      That experiences can be adequately explained in a naturalistic way demonstrates that interpreting these experiences in a supernatural way is not strictly rational.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
                  Supernatural hypotheses in general are due to the mind projection fallacy [6]. Higher-order conceptslive in the map, not the territory [7].

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con:
                    The parent, rather than providing any evidence against supernatural entities, dismisses them on the basis of how humans might come to believe in them. Thus the parent commits the genetic fallacy.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
                      Information is physically real, and obeys physical laws. [8] To learn of a thing, you must physically interact with it, through some chain of evidence. That some people believe a thing is, in fact, indirect Bayesian evidence for the thing. (If God exists, we can hardly expect fewer to believe than if not.) But that evidence is very weak, because it is second-hand and there are false positives. If we learn about evidence earlier in the chain, it screens off any later evidence from being relevant [9].

                        1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                        Each God claim would have to be considered as its own chain. We must ask, “which God is under consideration,” and then evaluate the relevant evidence. Thus, evidence that disproves Zeus does not necessarily disprove or even count as evidence against Jesus or Buddha. We must look at the evidence against each claim before ruling it out. We cannot make a blanket rejection against all gods simply because we have evidence that some of them are not real.

                        1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.2. Con:
                        The parent presupposes physicalism to be true. It thus begs the question.

                        1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3. Con:
                        The parent assumes that people’s claims to experiences of the supernatural are less real than their claims to experiences with the natural. This begs the question.

                          1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con:
                          It begs the question to call those experiences supernatural to begin with. Without evidence of supernatural origins they are simply experiences interpreted a certain way.

                            1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
                            By this logic, experiences with the physical are simply experiences interpreted a certain way. They aren’t necessarily “real” because there can be no evidence for the reliability of our five senses. Believing they are reliable is properly basic. Therefore, there can be no evidence the physical is real either.

                              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
                              By that logic how can you tell when you are awake vs when you are dreaming? The dream world seems to be the product of sense data. But we know which is real and which is the hallucination. It's the same with the so-called "supernatural" senses. We know it's the hallucination, not the reality, the same way.

                                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                This affirms the physical world is not believed on evidence. We assume that our sense data is telling us something about physical reality.

                                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                  No it doesn't. The physical world is believed on evidence.

                            1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Con:
                            The experience is the evidence of supernatural origins the same way experiences with the natural is evidence for natural origins.

                          1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2. Con:
                          It only asserts that natural explanations are at least as likely to produce the observed data as supernatural explanations. Thus the data is not evidence for the supernatural and is not enough to overcome its low prior.

                            1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1. Con:
                            The great grandparent literally says, “And natural explanations are far more probable than that.” This is clearly elevating natural explanations above supernatural ones.

                              1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1. Con:
                              Occam's razor supernatural explanations require more unjustified assumptions that the natural explanations do not require.

                                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1. Con:
                                To believe in natural reality, one must typically assume they have physical senses that are giving accurate information about that reality. To believe in the supernatural, one must assume they have spiritual senses that give accurate information about supernatural reality. Thus the epistemelogical assumptions to establish the possibility of natural and supernatural realms are equal.

                                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                  The senses physical or divine are pieces of supposed evidence and not assumptions in and of themselves. The naturalist need only assume that physical reality is actually real which is one singular assumption. Theists must also have an opinion on reality, if they assume it is real as well then they must make further assumptions that supernatural reality is real in addition to physical reality. If they deny that physical reality is real they require even more assumptions for the alternatives.

                                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                    This fails to distinguish between a metaphysical claim and the epistemological methods for arriving at knowing that claim. The epistemological assumptions for believing in the supernatural and the natural are the same.

                                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2. Con:
                                The only assumption necessary for the hypothesis, “the experience has a supernatural cause,” is that the supernatural is possible.

                                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
                                  A more correct definition of "simplest" is the Kolmogorov complexity i.e. the length of the shortest computer program that produces the object. To a human being, well adapted to interacting with other human beings, "Thor, God of Thunder, did it," really feels like a simpler explanation for a lightning bolt than Maxwell's partial differential equations of electromagnetism. But any software engineer knows that programming the mind of an intelligent being is even harder than calculus.

                                  1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2. Con:
                                  The hypothesis also requires the natural to be possible because the person having the experience is a physical being.

                                    1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1. Con:
                                    The supernatural hypothesis requires no assumptions to be made about the essence of human persons.

                                      1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                                      In order for a physical entity to experience something supernatural one must assume that the physical world exists as well as the supernatural and that they can interact.

                                        1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                                        That assumes a human person is a physical entity which is not a necessary assumption for a supernatural hypothesis. It is better to make no assumptions about the nature of human persons as we look at the evidence.

                                          1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                          To assume that a human person has no physical components whatsoever requires opinions and assumptions about the nature of our reality. The physical world cannot be real in this instance and neither can it be a simulation since that would need to be simulated on something. The only remaining option is that the physical world is not physical at all but just the "dream" of some supernatural being. This requires even more assumptions than assuming the physical world is real.

                                            1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                            It is unclear the only remaining option is that the physical world is a "dream" of some supernatural being. If the physical realm can just exist without any explanation, then so can the supernatural.

                                            The supernatural hypothesis has made no assumptions about the nature of humans. Thus to say, "to assume that a human person has no physical components whatsoever" is an unjustified accusation. If this assumption was made the supernatural hypothesis would beg the question! Thus no assumption has been made or needs to be made about the nature of human persons.

Since the event is either in the natural world or interacts with it the hypothesis being a cause and effect statement does require assumptions about the natural world it claims to be interacting with.

The supernatural hypothesis would leave open the possibility that persons only exist in a supernatural reality and the physical world is just a projected reality persons use to commune. Or it could be that only God exists and reality is a projection of his mind. In the same way the natural hypothesis makes no assumption about the supernatural, the supernatural makes no assumption about natural.

                                  It is possible that the human person having the experience is a supernatural entity themself. Since assuming this would beg the question, one should not make any assumptions about the nature of human persons.

Occam's razor speaks only to the likelihood of hypotheses it does not require them to be actually realizable or true. Stating that the natural hypothesis is more probably in no way requires the possibility of the supernatural let alone any assumptions about it.

It is possible that the laws of reality do not allow for the characteristics or omniscience, omnipotence or omnibenevolence to exist in actuality. Thus, it may or may not be possible.

                                                Propositions are either true or false [13]. While we can argue about the plausibility of any given proposition, it doesn't make sense to talk about the plausibility of possibility. For example, we can say proposition (X) is 1% possible. However, it doesn't make sense to say that the 1% possibility of X is 1% possible. This is what the parent is trying to do by saying, "it may be possible."

It is possible that x can exist in a realizable world is also either true or false. If X exists then x is possible but if x does not exist we do not immediately know whether or not x is possible.

For any proposition (X), we would say, "X is possible," followed by, "it is possible that X is possible,"followed by, "it is possible that it is possible that X is possible" followed by, "it is possible that it is possible that it is possible that X is possible."

If P is false Q may be true or Q may be false. Z is it is possible that Q is true. If Q is true then Z is true. If Q is false then Z is false because if it is not possible for P to be true it is necessary that P is false, if it is necessary for P to be false it is necessary that Q is false and by extension Z. If Q is false then there is no possibility Q could have been true.

This would read, "it is possible that it is possible that is it possible God exists." Thus, Z is unecessary and if it is insisted that it is valid, it becomes an arbitrary stopping point (there is no reason we shouldn’t move on to Y).

It is not an arbitrary stopping point because Q does not follow from P in all cases but Z follows from Q. Any logical proposition can be extended infinitely by adding tautologies to it just as those are unnecessary and add nothing extra levels beyond Q are the same.

[34] One of these possible impacts is spiritual blindness which means the more license sin has to control us, the more it keeps us in the dark. This is a problem for atheists and theists alike. Since the grandparent relates to belief in God, atheists appear singled out. However, the noetic affects of sin would apply to theists as much as atheists.

For atheists, it may affect their belief in God but not necessarily their personal morals (there are many moral atheists that would put theists to shame). For the theist, sin could keep them entrapped in their sin and committed to a way of life that God never intended for them to live. The impacts are different, but theists are subject to the effects of sin as well.

The mere fact that we have beliefs that spring from mental tools  is totally irrelevant to the justification of beliefs that spring from them.

                    Every miracle is indeed false, for being a misinterpretation of its causes (a superstitious interpretation). Believing in this does not require faith, it only requires knowledge and understanding of the world (i.e. knowledge attained through science).

                    It requires no faith to reject claims which have not been verified. Every miracle is a supposed violation of the laws of nature and none of them have been proven or verified or recorded on video. Likewise it requires no faith to think that people are interpreting feelings of awe as something otherworldly and godly seeing as there is no evidence that the supernatural is actually involved.

                      The root of the problem is what one accepts as verification. To accept the laws of nature because of human attested experiences with nature and yet reject the supernatural in spite of human attested experiences with the supernatural is to put a high degree of faith in the natural vs the supernatural. The naturalist has faith that nature is the only real experience. Thus, both positions require a significant amount of faith. It is faith vs faith. Both are properly basic beliefs.

One rejects supernatural experiences because people simply assert "I have felt god". Their feeling is impossible to verify and illusions and misconceptions require no supernatural explanation. Only the supernatural position requires faith because it posits a supernatural realm where none is needed to explain the world. Faith is belief with no evidence naturalism has evidence.

                            In science our senses are used indirectly for verification. Modern day experiments have little direct human intervention and our senses only come into looking at the outputted data. That data can then be viewed by everyone who has access to the internet. In order for this to be invalid all of reality must be fake. However even if this is conceded to be faith the religious also must rely on reality existing. Belief in god then has faith that both reality is real and that the supernatural is real.

                              The parent reveals its presupposition in the statement, “reality is real” and contrasting this with the “supernatural is real.” This reveals a clear bias for calling the natural world “real” without providing any evidence for this. This is the matter at hand! It is taken on faith that the natural world is real! This is appropriate for this belief is properly basic as is belief in the supernatural.

                                The quote reality is real is in a sentence saying faith in reality being real would be necessary meaning it does not presuppose that. It is simply stating that if it must be faith for the scientist to believe that the physical world is real the theist must have double the faith for they must believe both in the physical world and in the supernatural one. The parent is taking things out of context and misconstruing the meaning.

                                                In his published works [67], Habermas quotes and presents the viewpoints of many well known skeptics to the facts of the life of Jesus and presents their viewpoints. Clearly, He is not "ignoring" skeptics/agnostics, nor is he "cherry-picking" from theists.

                                                It is improper to make the leap from thousands of written "sources" (Habermas's actual claim) to thousands of "authors", since authors on a topic likely wrote more than one thing on the topic. It is again improper to leap from dozens of biased authors to the majority of "scholars" as the grandparent claims. These could be street preachers parroting talking points for all we know, not professors doing original research.

                                                Habermas ignores the excluded middle. He counts two categories of authors who bothered writing something either pro or con on the topic, ignoring the third category of scholars who are agnostic or couldn't be bothered. Then he can pretend that the minority who actually accept his biased view are the majority.

These authors are not free [68] to follow the evidence (they'd risk their careers), but must build a case for their presupposed bottom line [69]. Those authors cannot be reliable.

Therefore, assuming that non-theist scholars are more neutral would be like assuming that people who have never tasted beer are the most neutral judges about whether beer is enjoyable. Perhaps they’re less biased by the alcohol, but surely those who have concluded that beer is enjoyable are likely to have decided to taste one.

But what is the argument itself? Habermas's database is secret, therefore we're taking his word for it. There is no argument but the authority of the messenger in this case, thus there is nothing to attack but the messenger's authority.

One must explore each hypothesis in turn and not dismiss it outright by appealing to inductive evidence that resurrection is impossible. The only reason to rule out the possibility that a deity raised Jesus from the dead is to presuppose that God does not exist (which begs the question).

Comparison of the narratives of the four gospels shows that their accounts do not diverge from one another until after the burial.

According to Josephus, the testimony of women was regarded as so worthless that it could not even be admitted into a Jewish court of law. Any later legendary story would certainly have made male disciples discover the empty tomb.

The earliest Jewish response to the disciples’ proclamation, “He is risen from the dead!” was not to point to his occupied tomb and to laugh them off as fanatics, but to claim that they had taken away Jesus’ body. Thus, we have evidence of the empty tomb from the very opponents of the early Christians.

For hallucinations require a special psychological state on the part of the percipient. But since a guilt complex ex hypothesi obtained only for Peter and Paul, the diversity of the postmortem appearances must be explained as a sort of contagion, a chain reaction. But Lüdemann is unable to provide any example of this.

In the first place, Lüdemann's imaginative reconstruction of Peter's emotional state following his denials and Jesus's crucifixion fails to diagnose correctly the true problem Peter faced. It was not so much that he had failed his Lord as that his Lord had failed him! Lüdemann thus fails to enter into the mindset of a first century Jew who had been following a failed Messianic pretender.

There is no reason to think that the early church would generate fictitious stories concerning the unbelief of Jesus’ family had they been faithful followers all along. But it is indisputable that James and his brothers did become active Christian believers following Jesus’ death.

What would it take to convince you that your brother is the Lord, such that you would be ready to die for that belief? Can there be any doubt that this remarkable transformation in Jesus’ younger brother took place because, in Paul’s words, “then he appeared to James”?

                                        We need not concern ourselves with defending the Gospels’ every claim attributed to Jesus because critical evaluation factors can assess the probability of specific events surrounding Jesus’ life. These include historical congruence, independent, early attestation, embarrassment, dissimilarity, semitisms, and coherence.

                                  The Jewish transmission of sacred traditions was highly developed and reliable. In an oral culture like that of first century Palestine the ability to memorize and retain large tracts of oral tradition was a highly prized and highly developed skill. From the earliest age children in the home, elementary school, and the synagogue were taught to memorize faithfully sacred tradition. The disciples would have exercised similar care with the teachings of Jesus.

                                      It is possible that Jesus' miracles could have natural explanations. For example, Jesus may have found someone prone to epileptic fits and a gullible audience, waited until he had a seizure, and claimed it was caused by evil spirits. Then he could have yelled at him until the seizure stopped on its own giving him the credit for "curing" the demon possessed person.

It is highly unlikely [91] that some future archaeologist is going to find an inscription where Amenhotep II touts that a foreign “god” [i.e. Yahweh of the Jews] made a mockery of the Egyptian gods (including the Pharaoh who was himself considered a god), defeated his armies in the desert, and safely delivered an enslaved people to freedom.

The city was the capital of the Hyksos [95] rule of Egypt (Hyksos were a group of people of mixed origins who conquered Egypt and became its pharaohs). The Hyksos were expelled with the formation of the 18th Dynasty and the capital was moved to Thebes resulting in the decline of Avaris. While it is not specifically known what caused the abandonment archaeological evidence suggests the Israelites were not there to begin with. [96]

Yet during the hieght of Egypt’s enterprise and glory, her naval base was abandoned mysteriously and her imperialistic machinery ground to a halt. Egypt sought to make treaties rather than seize whatever she desired.

Avaris acted as the gateway between Egypt and Asia almost uninterruptedly from before the middle of the second millennium BC until nearly the end of the millennium. The site was instrumental for controlling foreign trade, launching supporting military operations, defending the heartland of the Nile Valley, and preserving an important part of Egypt’s religious heritage.

There was also a potential interruption in the high priesthood of Amun during this time. This may be intricately bound to the military and political turmoil of his Year-9. Therefore, a religious crisis focused on Amun-Re at this time may have been initiated by Amenhotep II as a result of a devastating loss in battle [100] (such as the loss of forces in the Red Sea).

                                        This is because scholarly groups like the Jesus Seminar [119] don’t conclude the Gospels are inaccurate.

                                          Their reasoning goes something like this: It's impossible for the Gospels to be historically accurate, because they record things that simply can't happen, like dead people coming alive again and food multiplying--miracles, in other words. We live in a closed universe of natural order, with God (if there is a God) locked out of the system. If miracles can't happen, then the reports in the New Testament must be fabrications. Therefore, the Gospels are not historical.

                      It is not simply that Individuals attest to these experiences out of the blue. In some cases they expect to have supernatural experiences. For example, Christians believe that upon accepting Christ, God through the divine person of the Holy Spirit, comes to dwell within them. Thus they expect to sense God’s presence everyday. They then attest to daily fellowship with God. This is not just consistent with a supernatural hypothesis, but is positive evidence for it.

                        The experience of the Holy Spirit among Christians is widely shared and difficult to explain until it is experienced. Christians always understand what one another means by this experience; however, they find it difficult to explain and express in physical terms. This is likely because it is not just a physical experience.

                  This is a faulty comparison. If this particular experience were true, you could search for physical evidence of knife wounds on the body.

                  The experience as it stands does make it possible that it occurred. However, there is only one data point (the person who experienced it). If the experience was shared by more than one person, then we would have many data points to consider thus making it not only possible this specific event actually occurred, but more plausible than the testimony of one.

              A person's explanation of their experience is not how one established possibility or probability. Both are established by validation of events -- at the least of causes of the same genre. en.wikipedia.org [125]

                1.1.1.2.2.1.2.7.1. Con:
                The most frequent cause given for spiritual events is “God.” What people mean by God can vary; however, specific “genres” of experiences with God happen frequently enough that reliable testimony exists. For example, many Christians, who compose the worlds largest religion, claim to experience the presence of the Holy Spirit on a daily basis. This sample size of millions of individuals makes the spiritual at least possible.

            1.1.1.2.2.1.3. Pro:
            According to Leibniz’s Law of the Indiscernibility of Identicals (For any X and any Y, if X = Y (i.e., X is identical to Y), then for all properties P, P is true of X if and only if P is true of Y), then if the brain is the same thing as the mind (an immaterial soul), then we would expect all properties about the brain to be true of the mind. There are good reasons for thinking a mental property isn’t physical. Therefore, the brain and mind are different substances.

              1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1. Con:

                1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.1. Con:
                The problem of inverted qualia [126] is evidence against functionalism. Functionalists make the defining characteristics of a mental state the logical or causal relations of input and output to the organism and not the internal traits of the state itself known directly through introspective awareness. Since two different mental states (sensing red or sensing blue) can be consistent with the same functional states, the latter cannot be identified with the former. Thus functionalism is false.

                1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2. Con:
                The problem of absent qualia [127] is evidence against functionalism. According to functionalism, if unconscious machines like a robot are able to imitate consciousness by embodying the right functional state, then they are, in fact, in that mental state. This seems wrong. If a robot can be set up to grimace, shout "Ouch!" and so forth after being stuck with a pin, the robot would still not be in the state of being in pain because the specific conscious property of painfulness would be absent.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.1. Pro:
                  The Chinese Room [128] thought experiment demonstrates functionalism to be false. The Chinese room with the person inside would simulate a computer to an outside person and represents a functionalist account of mental states like thinking and understanding meaning. For a person outside, the room receives input and gives output in a way that makes it appear that the room understands Chinese. But all the room really does is imitate mental understanding. It does not possess it.

                    Mental understanding is not a well defined or understood process. Therefore, it is unjustified to declare that the room in conjunction with the man and the program do not understand Chinese.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.1.3. Con:
                    Depersonalization [130] is a common phenomenon. In the event the persons thoughts no longer appear causally related with actions and the person feels as if they are not controlling their body. Yet the body continues to act and even speak on its own. Therefore, a conscious piloter is not required for understanding of a language. The body as would the room actually possess understanding.

                      1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.1.3.1. Pro:
                      To claim that consciousness is required for understanding in this scenario one would have to posit that either the body does not understand or that there is a second virtual mind in the person's head. The latter would render the virtual mind [131] reply to the chinese room valid. The former would be counter intuitive since the brain has stored all the information necessary to use and understand the language and the chinese room argument is based on intuition in the first place.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.2. Con:
                  That seems wrong does not in fact mean it is wrong. As a person one intuitively believes that there is something special about how humans perceive the world and experience it. There is however no evidence that illustrates that said machine would not have an internal monologue the same as our own.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.3. Con:
                  This is a strawman. The automaton described lacks the neural correlates of consciousness. It has no internal model of self, thus can't be said to be self aware. If it had them in the same way humans do then it would, in fact, be conscious. Even if they were not made of living neural cells. There is nothing magical about biological matter--it follows the laws of chemistry.

                    1.1.1.2.2.1.3.1.2.3.1. Con:
                    The grandparent describes accurately what a functionalist [132] would affirm. There is no strawman here. Since mental states are identified by a functional role, they are said to be realized on multiple levels; in other words, they are able to be manifested in various systems, even perhaps computers, so long as the system performs the appropriate functions.

                When we think about certain concepts or feel certain emotions, we consistently use the same region of our brains. In some cases, a neuroscientist [133] can tell what people are thinking and feeling through observation, even before the person is conscious of the thought or emotion.

                  1.1.1.2.2.1.3.2.1.1. Con:

              1.1.1.2.2.1.3.4. Pro:
              People have first person awareness of their mental states. Intentionality, the ability for mental sensations to be about something or aimed toward something, isn’t a physical state. One can inspect their thoughts, feelings, and other sensations to see what they are about. No one else will be able to do this simply by looking at the chemical and physical interactions within their brain.

              There is no evidence, that out of body experients can get a 'hit' on hidden, secret and real-time targets. That suggests that the 'disembodied-eyes' type theories you refer to - that is the idea that some entity literally leaves the body - are probably wrong.

There is no fact that could be discovered in neuroscience that could prove substance dualism false.

Volition would last beyond death of the body and thus is part of the soul.

      Free will may not exists. It's a "begging the question" fallacy to assert it's generated or caused so your conclusion can be tossed out.

        1.1.1.3.1. Con:
        It is not question begging to assert Freewill in an argument for God. It is simply an invalid argument (in that the premise -- freewill -- is not sufficiently defended).

        1.1.1.3.2. Con:
        Free Will must exist, because only a Free entity can be certain that it accepts arguments solely on the grounds of reason and not due to some irrational constraints.

          1.1.1.3.2.1. Con:
          Pure reason may be deterministic, and therefore reason doesn't have to rely on free will at all.
          Also, brains could be determined and approximate reason. Brains and minds could be influenced to approximate to (and improve) reason.
          Therefore, freewill does not have to be assumed to get to reason.

          1.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
          The premise "Only a free entity can can reason" (even if true, which I doubt) doesn't lead to there being free entities. It may mean that we are not reasoning right now at all.

          1.1.1.3.2.3. Con:
          This dismisses the possibility that it could have been determined that an entity is certain arguments would be accepted on the grounds of reason. All other options to the contrary have not been ruled out.

      1.1.1.4. Con:
      Free will can't be given... It is a self defeating premise in that we do not have the free will to accept or refuse free will. We have free will because we don't have a choice.

        1.1.1.4.1. Con:
        Having the capacity to will freely does not imply the power to do what is willed. Whereas it is true that we cannot control whether we have free will or not, we are capable of having the will to not possess free will.

          1.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
          Free will is the ability to choose between different possible courses of action unimpeded. The ability to choose, think, and act voluntarily. Not having the power to do as willed contradicts free will.

      1.1.1.5. Con:
      As a human being, assume I have Free Will. But I have no way to grant that property to another entity. If I use my Free Will to control the entity's actions, they're just a puppet--it's my Free Will, not theirs. Free Will is not transferable, so the parent is nonsensical.

      1.1.1.6. Con:
      The idea that Freewill needs to be caused by another freewill has two problems:
      (a) It is not demonstrated that freedom of will cannot come about by other means.
      (b) It leads to an infinite regress.

        1.1.1.6.1. Con:
        God has free will by necessity of Its nature, therefore there is no infinite regress in claiming freewill can only come from other freewill.

          1.1.1.6.1.1. Con:
          The assertion that God can have freewill by necessity is to contradict the grandparent claim that freewill cannot be generated by a cause that doesn't possess freewill. That is special pleading.

          1.1.1.6.1.2. Con:
          The assertion that God can have freewill by necessity is to contradict the grandparent claim that freewill cannot be generated by a cause that doesn't possess freewill. It therefore gets rid of the causation problem that leads to an infinite regress that makes God's freewill 'necessary'

      1.1.1.7. Con:
      Argument from ignorance. Just because you don't know how humans might get free will, doesn't mean you can say it's a god that gives it.

                1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                A "special providence," which would be an act of God planned for a certain time and place within the universe based on God's omniscience, would not leave any special traces because these actions would be consistent with natural law.

                  1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  As it would be consistent with natural laws this action would be undetectable. However, by the same token there is no reason to suspect such events actually occur since they are in line with natural laws. There is no need for an outside and supernatural explanation at all.

                    1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    The lack of need for a supernatural explanation does not lead to, "there is no God that interacts with the world."

                      1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                      That lack of need does however lead to "there is no reason to think that there is a god that interacts with the world."

                    1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                    Whether God acts providentially in the universe will largely depend on whether God exists or not and if He has revealed himself in some way. If the arguments for God's existence (from natural theology) are convincing enough to make God's existence probable (or even possible), then there is no reason to rule out the possibility of special providence or even supernatural miracles. Thus there is no reason to think that a God that interacts with the world is at all unlikely.

                      1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                      Claiming an event known to have happened and verified to have happend as an act of special providence is by its very nature unfalsifiable and cannot have any evidence in support of it. It essentially boils down to giving god credit for some event that could be explained by natural means. Now this is obviously possible but it adds unnecessary assumptions going against occams razor. This should induce doubt as to the reasonableness or probability that divine providence is an actuality.

                        1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                        Not all special providences would be unfalsifiable because there could be evidence against the events. For example, the biblical story of the Israelite's crossing the Jordan River is falsifiable. One could claim that God communicated to the Israelites that He would stop the waters of the Jordan River that they might cross. This would be a great reason for Israel to think that God was the one who dried up the river when they crossed it, even if God only accomplished this through natural means.

                          1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                          One could falsify this account of special providence by undermining the credibility of the Bible, showing that event in question is not historical, pointing to evidence from secular sources that counters the possibility of this action of special providence. Thus, claims of special providence are falsifiable.

                          1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Con:
                          The claim that god communicated with these people or in current days a claim that god has communicated with an individual is unverifiable. For example if someone expected for some reason that the river would dry up by natural causes he could claim god told him so and no one could falsify that claim.

                        1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con:
                        Personal testimony combined with an expectation that God would act is adequate evidence for the possibility of a special providence. Since there can be evidence for the event, they can be falsified.

                          1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
                          The gospel of Matthew (8:5-13) attests to a Roman Centurion that came and asked Jesus to heal his servant. Jesus told him that his servant would be healed and the servant did recover. It is possible that this was a special providence (the servant could have already been on the mend). In this story we have the testimony of Matthew to the event in question combined with the expectation that God would act. This greatly increases the probability that a special providence occurred.

                            1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                            Assuming this event actually occurred it is entirely possible that Jesus knew that the servant would heal on his own and said god would heal him knowing that god would be credited for an act that had nothing to do with god. Assuming Jesus actually existed then it is possible that all of these supposed acts of providence or miracles were simply the equivalent of parlor tricks. There is no way to know the difference now that the supposed events are so far in the past.

                          1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.2. Pro:
                          There are stories of Jesus telling his disciples to cast a net of fish on one side of their boat to catch fish. The disciples obey and end up catching so many fish that the boats almost overturn. This would be a special providence that is testified by the authors of the gospels and contains an expectation that God would act (God implied the net would fill with fish).

                            By the definition given for divine providence it does not break the natural laws. Assuming the event described actually took place Jesus could have known ahead of time that there would be an absurd amount of fish there and simply attributed it to divine providence. That this event was divinely inspired rather than resulting from chance or prediction is unfalsifiable.

                    *There is no reason at all to think that if God were to make his existence more manifest, more people would come into a saving relationship with him. Mere showmanship will not bring about a change of heart.

                        1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                        No confidence. But there would be no reason to ask: "Did he exist?"

                    1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Con:
                    Assuming God is interested in "building a love relationship with us" humans, implies that God wants us to believe He exists because one can't have loving relationships with Being(s) that do not exist. Believing existence is a necessary first step.

                      1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1. Con:
                      Christianity does not hold (3). Under Christianity, God wants everyone to freely enter into a loving relationship with Him. This is separate from belief.

                        1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1. Pro:
                        Belief is required before one can enter this relationship; however, it could be the case that certain people would reject God in any possible world so belief wouldn’t help.

                          1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
                          Even if we grant (for argument) that certain people would reject God in any possible world, this doesn't apply to all atheists. So what of the others? Belief would certainly help them. Thus Drange's argument still applies.

                            1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                            The parent is again an argument from omniscience. It could very well be that ALL those who don’t accept God in this world would not accept Him in any possible world. We would need to be omniscient to know.

                              1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                              Omniscience is not required. A single counterexample will suffice. Many atheists have claimed that they would accept a benevolent God if He exists.

                        1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.2. Pro:
                        It could be the case that a world that includes people who don’t believe in God is better than one where everyone that exists believes in God. We would need to be omniscient to know what is best.

                        You cannot love what you ignore that exist, therefore god should want people to know him in order to want them to choose freely wether to love him or not.

                    Loving relationship with people is not how God is portrayed in the Old Testament.

              1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3. Con:
              The parent doesn't claim that God deceives us. It seems like words are being put into the mouth of the parent statement. I would suggest that writer demonstrates parent argument implies God is deceptive.

                Good explanations tend to be consistent with background knowledge. If your conjecture requires us to throw out everything we know about gravity and light and animals and humans, then that’s probably not the right explanation.

                  1.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.2.2. Con:
                  The argument should be addressed as is not by insisting on an unvoiced hidden interpretation of the parent.

        1.1.2.1.2. Pro:
        Most theists would be in full agreement with Hitchen’s razor as presented. However, the point of disagreement is what constitutes sufficient proof (and what counts as evidence) to establish a claim. Thus, Hitchen’s razor adds little towards solving the epistemological methods that are valid for establishing justification and warrant for our beliefs.

        1.1.2.1.3. Con:
        An actual objection to the parent hasn't been offered. Instead of addressing what has been stated and asking for evidence of it; the debater continues to object against an argument not offered by the parent.

        1.1.2.1.4. Con:
        If no proof can be produced, non existance of God can't be affirmed.

      1.1.2.2. Con:
      Nobody can prove the dragon in my garage [162] doesn't exist, therefore it does exist.

      1.1.2.3. Con:
      The inability to prove the non-existence of something does not mean this thing exists. One could apply this same logic and claim that nobody can prove that god isn't a chair, and therefore god must be a chair. Or anything. Because the unprovability of non-existence is a property of non-existing things.

      1.1.2.4. Con:
      The use of "prove" is tricky. If you mean prove in a mathematical sense then that is true but then we can't prove anything. 
      
      If you mean, No one can reasonably demonstrate God's non-existence that might be better.

    1.1.3. Pro:
    "Sensible things can’t exist except in a mind or spirit. From this I conclude not that they have no real existence but that—seeing they don’t depend on my thought, and have an existence distinct from being perceived by me—there must be some other mind in which they exist. As sure as the sensible world really exists, therefore, so sure is there an infinite, omnipresent Spirit who contains and supports it." George Berkeley

      1.1.3.2. Con:
      This doesn't seem to rule out panpsychism [163], the view that all material things also have an innate mental aspect. There's no need for a unified god/spirit to sustain the Universe if all the atoms individually have their own spirits. Thus, God need not exist.

        1.1.3.2.1. Pro:
        However, panpsychism, under either of its forms, still doesn't offer an adequate account. In emergent panpsychism, under which the material gives rise to the mental, the laws of emergence still remain a total mystery. In constitutive panpsychism, the question of what constitutes bedrock broaches the question of which is more fundamental: the physical or the mental? If either, constitutive panpsychism collapses into either physicalism or idealism, and if both, that's property dualism.

      1.1.3.3. Con:
      Mind emerges from matter, not the other way around.

        1.1.3.3.1. Pro:
        All known minds are embodied. Prove that a mind can exist without a body.

          1.1.3.3.1.1. Con:
          To say, “minds cannot exist without a body” is an unwarranted assumption. It is possible that minds exist beyond death or that there are minds without bodies that have yet to be discovered.

            1.1.3.3.1.1.1. Con:
            To say, "Abstract objects do not stand in causal relations" is an unwarranted assumption. It is possible that causal abstract objects exist that have yet to be discovered.
            
            Because of this parallel, we can see that the argument "so it must be a mind" is still special pleading.

              1.1.3.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              An argument of the form "A, B, C, are impossible (for some number of impossible claims), therefore it must be D (which is also normally impossible)" is special pleading because it could be just as easily rendered "B, C, D are impossible, therefore it must be A".

        1.1.3.3.2. Con:
        The existence of mind is a properly basic belief, i.e. your own mind is self-evident. The existence of matter is just an inference. If the existence of one of these two substances must be discarded, it can't be the mind.

    1.1.4. Pro:
    According to William Ln. Craig’s Moral Argument [164] for God’s Existence, if God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist. Since objective moral values and duties do exist, it follows that God has to exist as well.

      1.1.4.1. Con:
      Across cultures and histories these moral experiences and intuitions have varied. This makes them an unreliable guide to what is right and wrong and insufficient warrant for believing in the objectivity of morality.

        1.1.4.1.1. Con:
        Our five physical senses aren’t infallible, but that doesn’t lead us to think that there is no external world around us. In the same way, our moral sense can be less than perfect, but this shouldn’t make us doubt that objective moral values and duties exist.

          1.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
          Physical reality is a shared referent that allows us to calibrate, by investigation, any variation from our senses. No such referent we can investigate exists for morality.

            1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
            Moral reality is also a shared referent that allows us to calibrate, by investigation, any variation from our moral sense.

              1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              Humans can observe, hypothesize, and test moral reality.

                1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                Ethics or moral philosophy [165] is a branch of philosophy that involves systematizing, defending, and recommending concepts of right and wrong conduct. Moral philosophy is a project that attempts to use reason to answer various kinds of ethical questions.

                1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                Thought experiments [166] are approaches for testing moral reality. One such process could be: 
                
                (1) A scenario and a question are introduced.
                (2) The experimenter goes through (imagines, thinks about, etc.) the scenario and arrives at some
                result.
                (3) A conclusion is drawn with respect to some target (e.g., an ethically relevant claim or distinction).

              1.1.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
              Humans can achieve moral progress.

              1.1.4.1.1.1.1.3. Pro:
              In nation states, laws are established and modified over time. These are the result of moral debate over what is right and wrong based on our collective moral experiences.

        1.1.4.1.2. Con:
        Across cultures and histories, moral values have actually varied very little.

          1.1.4.1.2.1. Pro:
          Kinkier, Kernes, and Dautheribes (2000) in a study [167] of the worlds greatest religions and secular organizations (atheists), found that the moral values of commitment to something greater than oneself, self-respect (but with humility, self-discipline, and acceptance of personal responsibility), respect and caring for others, and caring for living things and the environment are shared by most and some cases all of these segments.

          1.1.4.1.2.2. Pro:
          S.H. Schwartz, in a survey [168]of 25,000 people in 44 countries with a wide range of different cultural types suggest that there are fifty-six specific universal values and ten types of universal values. These types include power, achievement, hedonism, stimulation, self-direction, universalism, benevolence, tradition, conformity, and security.

          1.1.4.1.2.3. Con:
          If there was very little variance in whether people liked a given foodstuff, that would not make it "objectively tasty", so by analogy a lack of variation in moral values does not make moral preferences objectively true.

      1.1.4.2. Con:
      If God exists, He must be evil [169]. Therefore, He cannot be the source of moral values.

        Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?"

        1.1.4.2.3. Pro:
        1 A being has maximal depravity in a given possible world W iff it is omnipotent, omniscient and wholly evil in W; and
        2 A being has maximal evilness if it has maximal depravity in every possible world.
        3 It is possible that there is a being that has maximal evilness. (Premise)
        4 Therefore, possibly, it is necessarily true that an omniscient, omnipotent, and perfectly evil being (OOPEB) exists.
        5 Therefore, (by axiom S5) it is necessarily true that an OOPEB exists.
        6 Therefore, an OOPEB exists.

          1.1.4.2.3.1. Con:
          The concept of perfectly evil being is untenable. There is no such thing as evil without there first being something to pervert. Thus, this evil being could not be maximally great (because it depends on goodness to be evil), only quasi-great. Thus it becomes a question of whether quasi-maximal greatness is compatible with maximal greatness. It is not. Therefore, there is no OOPEB.

            1.1.4.2.3.1.1. Con:
            The concept of perfectly good being is untenable. There is no such thing as good without there first being something evil to right. Thus, this good being could not be maximally great (because it depends on evilness to be good), only quasi-great. Thus it becomes a question of whether quasi-maximal greatness is compatible with maximal greatness. It is not. Therefore, there is no Being of Maximal Goodness.

              1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
              There is nothing evil in existence that is not the degradation or perversion of something good. The good must come first because evil can’t exist without it.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                There are moral problems without clear solutions. Therefore, in these situations it is unclear that evil is the degradation of the good. For example, if the population grows, the time always come, when there is not enough food. You can then fight for food or die by starvation. Killing others for food could be seen as evil. Alternatively, being killed by others for food and dying could also be evil. Or waiting collectively to see who will starve first could also be evil.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The parent is a false comparison. It presents a moral choice rather than a clear example of something existing as fundamentally evil that hasn’t ever been good.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                  Difficult moral problems with unclear answers do nothing to hinder our ability to realize that some things really are good or evil.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.2. Con:
                Functional pain receptors are not a degradation or perversion. They are just evil.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  Functional pain receptors are good as long as they are functioning properly. If they cease to function properly, this is a degradation of what is good.

                    1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    If pain is part of correct functioning, it begs the question why a loving God didn’t create creatures that could function without experiencing pain.

                      1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      Stating that pain is incompatible with a loving God simply restates the problem of evil. This does not move the argument forward.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.3. Con:
                If we create a world, where evil is inevitable, we can't call evil degradation or perversion. It's just part of the system.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.3.1. Con:
                  The fact that evil is allowed to be part of a world does not change what it is.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.4. Con:
                The definition of evil is not universally agreed upon.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.4.1. Con:
                  If evil is without clear definition, then the problem of a OOPEB evaporates. If we can't even begin to define what such a being would be like, then we don't need to worry that a maximally great version of such a being exists.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.4.2. Pro:

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.1.1.4.6. Con:
                  Evil’s multiple definitions is a problem for the person advancing the argument against God’s existence on the basis of evil as they carry the burden of proof. They must clearly articulate what is meant by evil if they want the argument to be coherent.

                A double negative can create a positive. Evolution is the canonical example: the two evils of mutation and death creates the functional order we observe in the kingdoms of life. There is no reason to think the good is somehow more fundamental.

            1.1.4.2.3.1.2. Pro:
            Maximal greatness is logically incompatible with quasi-maximal greatness.

              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.1. Pro:
              By definition, a maximally great being is omnipotent and no concrete object can exist independently of its creative power. An omnipotent being must also have the power to freely refrain from creating anything at all, so that there must be possible worlds in which nothing other than the maximally great being exists. If maximal greatness is possible, quasi-maximal greatness is not.

              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.2. Pro:
              A quasi-excellent being (that is, a being which has lots of excellent properties but which does not exist in every possible world) may exist in many worlds (worlds in which the maximally great being has chosen to create it), but such a being would lack necessary existence and thus not be quasi-maximally great.

              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.3. Con:
              We have no way of knowing “a priori” whether maximal greatness or quasi-maximal greatness is possibly exemplified. It cannot be both, but we have no idea if either is possible.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.2.3.1. Con:
                The intuition that a maximally great being possibly exists has priority over any intuition that a quasi-maximally great being possibly exists. The latter intuition seems to depend on the former, and yet upon reflection we come to lose the latter intuition through the realization that if a maximally great being is possible then a quasi-maximally great being is not.

              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4. Con:
              "Maximally Great" is a term without meaning, arbitrary. I am MG at being myself. The universe is MG because nothing has more power than it; given the law of conservation of mass/energy and our inability to peer into other possible realities. And so on.

                1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1. Con:
                What constitutes a ‘great-making’ property is to some degree debatable [170]. For example, is it greater to be timeless or omnitemporal? The answer is not clear. But our uncertainty as to what properties the greatest conceivable being must have does nothing to invalidate the definition of “God” as “the greatest conceivable being.” Here Anselm’s intuition which you mention seems on target: there cannot by definition be anything greater than God.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1. Con:
                  Our uncertainty means the supposed "greatest conceivable being" is inconceivable.

                      Omniscience is incompatible with free will.
                      
                      If your actions a predetermined, then you cannot be their author; you cannot have chosen otherwise. If God knows your future, then your actions are predetermined. If God does not know your future then he is not omniscient/not God.

                        This argument can be represented as follows: 
                        
                        1. If God is omniscient, then God foreknows the actions of His creatures before they make them. 
                        2. God is omniscient. 
                        3. Therefore, He foreknows the actions of His creatures. 
                        4. Therefore, all human actions are predetermined?!?
                        
                        (4) is a non-sequitur. Thus the argument is invalid.

                          1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                          (4) There is nothing incompatible with God foreknowing the actions of man and man's free will. Just because God knows what decisions man will make in any given situation, does not imply that God removes their free choices. For example, in the case of some persons, it could be that in any possible world they would reject a relationship with God their creator. Therefore, there is no violation of free will if God actualizes a world that includes these individuals freely rejecting God.

                            1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:

                            If a choice can be predicted with perfect certainty before it is made, that choice is not meaningfully "free".

                          1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                          If an action is fore-knowable, it cannot be free, as freedom requires the possibilities of both acting and not acting.

                        1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                        To know something, there must be some matter of fact about it to be known. Freedom consists in there not being a matter of fact: all options one may choose from could become fact or not. Thus foreknowledge of actions entails non-freedom.

                        If God could do the logically impossible (like creating a square circle), this would be an imperfection because God is rational by the necessity of His own nature. Thus, God’s inability to do anything illogical is not an imperfection, but rather a perfection. Omnipotence therefore is the ability to do anything logically possible in accordance with God's will.

                            The parent’s use of the word “bound” is a gross mischaracterization of what it means for God to be unable to do illogical things. God is not “bound” per say by logic. That would imply that logic is some necessarily existent thing that exercises power over God. Rather, God is rational by His very nature. Hence, logic emanates forth from who God is . This is very different from being “bound” by logic.

                          This reduces the maximal trait of "ALL powerful" to "God can do all things that God can do", which is a tautology. The same could be said of men, that doesn't make them "omnipotent".

                            According to Wayne Grudem, God’s omnipotence means that God is able to do all his holy will. There is nothing incoherent or ill defined about this attribute.

                              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                              Opponents to the coherence of God frequently set up a strawman arguments that assume omnipotence is the attribute of “being able to do anything.” This is a false representation of what theologians mean by omnipotence. Omnipotence is the attribute that means God can and always has been able to bring to accomplishment anything He wills without fail (nothing and no one can stop Him).

                                1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                                God’s inability to do everything, far from being an imperfection, is actually a perfection. For example, if God could sin or bring about the logically impossible, these would be imperfections making Him unworthy of worship. Thus, God being only able to accomplish anything he wills is a perfection, not an imperfection.

                                In other words, all that is required for a being to be omnipotent, is to not will what it cannot do. Any being with that kind of mental discipline is (by the above definition) omnipotent, regardless of its actual level of power.

They are limited in power and thus not omnipotent.

                                    This is important not because it implies humans may be omnipontent, but because it implies that "omniponent" being(s) (e.g. God) may have very little power at all. Then why call Him God?

As long as they do not will whatever they cannot do, they are omnipotent--even if they are incapable of doing things you could. So why call such a being "God"?

                                Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony or Tolstoy’s novel Anna Karenina exist and they are not identical to particular marks on paper or particular published books. These exist as sort of abstract entities. A physical copy of Anna Karenina or a score from Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony is just an instance of that. It is not the thing itself. Now, where did these come from? These would be examples of things that exist that have been created out of nothing by Tolstoy and Beethoven.

                                  Abstract objects do stand in causal relations to other abstract objects, as in timeless decision theory [177]. So the universe itself may be an abstract object with no need of transcendent mind(s) as its cause/explanation.

                                  All instantiations of Beethoven's Fifth (or whatever recorded work) require a physical substrate, and thus a material cause. Even a performance of the Symphony requires material air to conduct the sound waves.

                              1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                              If the universe had an absolute beginning (with nothing preceding it), the cause of the universe had no physical matter to act upon. Since out of nothing, nothing comes, the only alternative is creatio ex nihilo which involves the creation of matter out of nothing. This cause must be a transcendent, immaterial mind (what most people mean by God). Therefore, God is the efficient cause that brings all matter into existence.

                                  This easily fails Occam's razor test.
                                  There is no need to, or evidence requiring the attribution of a 'mind' or 'being' to the cause of creation.

                                    The universe is all of space-time reality and includes all matter and energy. Thus, if the universe has a cause of its existence, that cause must be non-physical and immaterial because it transcends space and time. There are only two kinds of things that could fall under such a description: either abstract objects (like a number) or else a mind (a soul, a self). Abstract objects don’t stand in causal relations. So it must be a mind.

                                      We have no accurate way of concluding that something can transcend space and time. As far as we know, space and time are the boundaries for existence, and cannot be surpassed. If it can transcend these regions of space, that requires demonstration to be sufficient.  Simply stating that it can transcend space and time has no actual meaning other than to try and rationalize a God concept.

                                        This means that the claim that God exists can have no less validity than the claim that God doesn't exist.

                                        The parent is irrelevant as an objection to premise 2. Premise 1 has already affirmed the universe has an explanation of its existence either in the necessity of its own nature or in an EXTERNAL cause. If it is external, this means it must transcend all space-time reality.

                                      Minds are abstract objects also (but complex ones), therefore there is only one kind of thing that could fall under such a description. But non-minds are the simpler abstract objects, thus preferred as explanations under Occam's razor.

This raises very fundamental questions about the nature of time, whether time is identical to the operationally defined quantities in physics or whether those quantities are, as I maintain, but measures of time, which exists independently of them. So long as the universe is expanding over time in the quantum gravity regime, the BGV theorem holds."

                                          Physicists have made equations [199] by combining quantum mechanics and general relativity resulting in a system that is stationary (the time parameter is not  involved). They then theorized [200] that to an outside observer the universe would be static. To an internal observer quantum entanglement would result in correlation based change where time is an emergent property. In 2013 [201] an experiment [202] was done that supported this model. Further info [203]. This would undermine the notion of time the parent relies on.

That is a different universe with a different arrow of time. It is in no sense an earlier stage of our universe.

So at the very most, the direction of entropy increase can serve as a measure of time but it is not time itself.

This theory is not accepted by a consensus of cosmologists. It is also far more complex than Einstein, while being experimentally identical, and is thus precluded by Occam's Razor. Craig's only answer to this is that Occam notwithstanding, God requires a privileged frame. So Kalam is ultimately circular.

                        1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.8.1. Pro:
                        Quantum physics, for example, is hard to explain because the concepts do not follow the same patterns humans are accustomed to, but yet it exists.

                          1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.8.1.1. Con:
                          Quantum physics can be fully described in the appropriate mathematical framework. This is not the case for God, for which there is no framework.

                          1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.8.1.2. Con:
                          Unlike God, quantum physics [208] can be proven in scientific experiments.

                        1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.8.2. Con:
                        Incoherence of a concept and being difficult to put into words are completely unrelated qualities. For example, the concept of a square circle is incoherent, but easy to express.

                        1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.8.3. Con:
                        If the word 'God' has no coherent definitions, then there are no examples in reality of something capable of being described as God.

                      1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.9. Pro:
                      If God created or caused the Universe, it remains undefined what created or caused God and why that term ought to be used or is in any way meaningful rather than terms like "Universe" or "cosmos".

                    1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.2. Pro:
                    It is futile for finite beings to propose they know the true nature of an infinite being. To attempt to do so would be the epitome of arrogance.

                    1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.3. Con:
                    Requiring a standard of certainty equal to 100% would result in everything being inconceivable.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.2. Pro:
                  Mere disagreement about whether a property is great-making does not imply that there is no objective truth about the matter. When we have a disagreement, then we may present arguments why we think it is greater to have some property than to lack it. The fact that some properties (like timelessness) are not clearly great-making does not imply that no properties are great-making or that the concept of a greatest conceivable being is wholly subjective.

                    1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.2.1. Con:
                    Transcendence ensures there can be no objective truth to terms and ideas we apply to God, by definition.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.3. Pro:
                  The concept of the greatest conceivable being is not the same as the concept of the greatest imaginable being. No advocate of Perfect Being Theology thinks that God is a being whose properties are contingent upon human cognition.

                  1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.4. Con:
                  Not having any clear meaning to "maximally great" certainly invalidates any argument that labels God so.

                    1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.4.1. Con:
                    The parent re-asserts the grandparent and is therefore, trivial.

          1.1.4.2.3.2. Con:
          Ontological arguments are inherently fallacious. One cannot simply define physical entities into existence.

            1.1.4.2.3.2.1. Con:
            The parent is a misrepresentation of ontological arguments. Ontological arguments don’t define just anything into existence. They are attempts to prove God’s existence from nothing but analytic, a priori and necessary premises to the conclusion that God exists. This is a far cry from “defining” an entity into existence.

        1.1.4.2.4. Pro:
        The pervasive existence in nature of Biological Exploitation [209], especially parasitism [210] and predation [211] causes immense suffering and death. An evil god could not have created a more vicious cycle if it tried: to live, animals are required to kill other life.

          1.1.4.2.4.1. Con:
          The parent is just one example. Even if we grant it as true, it is just one example of evil. It certainly isn't clear that evil outweighs good in this world. It is a complete matter of perception.

            1.1.4.2.4.1.1. Con:
            Red herring. The amount of good is not the point, it's the egregious amount of evil that's a problem.

              1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
              It is not a red herring to claim that evil is only evil in relation to good.

                1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                If one being is suffering, the fact that other beings are out having fun does not reduce the suffering of the one being one bit. It's a red herring.

                  1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The parent simply repeats the original problem, “there is evil.” It does little to demonstrate that evil is egregious. If I as an individual were going through extreme suffering, then evil would seem egregious to me. But it is not apparent that it is egregious on the whole once compared with all the people who aren’t in extreme suffering. Moreover, if a religion like Christianity is true, the suffering I face here no matter how terrible is nothing compared to the eternal reward that awaits.

                    1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    Christian faiths also teach that torment in Hell is eternal, so it cancels out. And they teach that that is the ultimate destiny of the majority of mankind. So if we can fairly bring eternity into the argument, the MAJORITY of people have it bad.

                      1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      In hell the majority of people have it infinitely bad. While a smaller portion in heaven would have it infinitely good. The number of Christians is growing slower than the general population. Thus the number of people in hell is growing faster than the number of people in heaven. Since the number in hell is growing faster, as time approaches infinity the ratio of suffering to happiness is going to be larger than 1. Can be evaluated despite both numbers going to infinity using L'Hopital's rule [212].

                      1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                      The parent confuses justice with evil within a Christian worldview. On the Christian worldview, hell is the just punishment given to unbelievers by a just God. One can attempt to argue from a Christian worldview that this is evil; however, they can’t assert it is evil by their own opinion. That amounts to individual distaste.

                    1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                    This is still a red herring. The amount of good is irrelevant to the question. It's the absolute amount of evil, in it's own right, that is evil.

                      1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                      It is not denied that evil is evil (regardless of the size). The objection at root is saying the amount is unjustified. For this to be true, we must consider the good accomplished in spite of the evil to determine if evil really is egregious.

                1.1.4.2.4.1.1.1.2. Con:

            1.1.4.2.4.1.2. Con:
            The grandparent does however present an example that could be fixed by an all powerful entity without impeding the human freedom.

              1.1.4.2.4.1.2.1. Con:
              The parent is also an argument from omniscience. There is no possible way that we can know the overwhelming number of factors that would allow God to accomplish goal X in a logically coherent way or in a way that creates the greatest result for goal X.

          1.1.4.2.4.2. Con:
          The reintroduction of predatory wolves to Yellowstone National Park led to enormous benefits [213] for the park. It certainly isn't clear that predatory behavior is inherently evil.

            1.1.4.2.4.2.1. Con:
            Red herring. This only proves the grandparent's point, that to live, animals are required to kill other life. The evil is inherent in the system. The Creator could have made the system work differently.

              1.1.4.2.4.2.1.1. Con:
              The creator could have made the system work differently. This can’t be denied. The question is, “could the system work without evil given that the designer has specific objectives?” It is far from apparent that this is the case. It is also far from apparent that the level of evil isn’t optimal to achieve said purposes. Again, one needs omniscience to know.

          1.1.4.2.4.3. Con:
          The overwhelming majority of biological creatures are not considered to be feel pain or to be consciously aware that they themselves are in pain [214].

            1.1.4.2.4.3.1. Con:
            It's debatable which animals are conscious, but certain animals are self-aware--they can recognize themselves in a mirror. This includes elephants, who, in the wild, slowly starve to death once they wear out their last set of teeth.

          1.1.4.2.4.4. Con:
          An evil god could, in fact, have created a more vicious version of life on Earth than in fact exists.

        1.1.4.2.5. Pro:
        The God of the Bible condones slavery. This is morally abhorrent.

        1.1.4.2.6. Pro:
        The God of the Bible commands genocide. This is morally abhorrent.

          1.1.4.2.6.1. Con:
          When God issues a command to a people to conduct an action that would normally be considered immoral (e.g. invasion of the Canaanite lands), it is no longer immoral but moral.

            1.1.4.2.6.1.1. Pro:
            According to the Bible, when God takes life or commands life to be taken, these are actions of justice (i.e. calling mankind into account for what they have done). Thus, murder is an inappropriate label.

              1.1.4.2.6.1.1.1. Pro:
              People who commit crimes deserve to be punished.

        1.1.4.2.7. Pro:
        The God of the Bible is a mass murderer.

          1.1.4.2.7.1. Pro:
          God killed almost all mankind during the Flood of Noah.

            1.1.4.2.7.1.1. Con:
            The flood was a worldwide judgement of mankind. Therefore, it was justice, not murder.

              1.1.4.2.7.1.1.1. Con:
              We don't murder the children of people who are sentenced to death.

                1.1.4.2.7.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The Bible teaches the salvation of infants [215] (i.e. innocent children). Thus, if God knew that in the current environment they would grow up to reject relationship with God, then killing them was a mercy.

              1.1.4.2.7.1.1.2. Con:
              The flood involved the killing of animals by drowning. This is unnecessary cruelty.

                1.1.4.2.7.1.1.2.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.4.2.4.3.

          1.1.4.2.7.2. Con:
          God is the author of life. Thus, some actions that it would be morally impermissible for a human person to do, are not immoral for God.

            1.1.4.2.7.2.1. Pro:
            God is under no obligation to extend the life of any human person.

            1.1.4.2.7.2.2. Pro:
            God has the right to end the life of any creature, free or otherwise, at any point He deems appropriate.

          -> See 1.1.4.2.6.1.1.

        1.1.4.2.8. Pro:
        Any moral person would prevent the rape or murder of a child in front of then if they had the power to stop it. God does not.

          1.1.4.2.8.1. Pro:
          Priests of God are often the perpetrators of child rape.

            1.1.4.2.8.1.1. Con:
            Free creatures making a choice to act against God's moral standard does not say anything negative about God.

          1.1.4.2.8.2. Pro:
          1 God is defined as a Being that is
           a. omnibenevolent,
           b. omnipresent,
           c. omnipotent, &
           d. that exists.
          2 God is a moral person. (1 a.)
          3 Child rape has occurred.
          4 By (1 b.) and (3), attempted child rape has occurred in the presence of God.
          5 By (1 c.) God had the power to prevent it.
          
          Thus, we cannot hold that any moral person would prevent the rape of a child in front of them if they had the power to stop it [216], by counterexample.
          
          Thus, there can be no moral problem with child rape per se.

            1.1.4.2.8.2.1. Con:
            To argue "if God exists He concurs with child rape," appeals to God as an objective standard for right and wrong and thus confirms the existence of objective moral values and duties.

              1.1.4.2.8.2.1.1. Con:
              If God is the standard of objective moral values and duties then the consequence of that is that there is no problem with child rape. It is obvious such a problem exists and therefore morals cannot come from God.

                1.1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1. Con:
                All that follows from the existence of child rape is that God concurs with (allows for) some number of instances of child rape. This just restates the problem that "evil and a good God are logically incompatible." It does not prove that God and evil are logically incompatible. One must prove that a good God would not allow child rape to occur.

            1.1.4.2.8.2.2. Con:
            -> See 1.1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.

            1.1.4.2.8.2.3. Pro:
            An omnibenevolent God would not allow for child rape to occur. Therefore, an omnibenevolent God does not exist.

              1.1.4.2.8.2.3.1. Con:
              It is possible that God has a morally sufficient reason for allowing child rape (and other evils) to occur.

                1.1.4.2.8.2.3.1.1. Pro:
                It is an argument from omniscience to assert that God does not have sufficient moral justification for allowing evil temporarily. God as omniscient would have insight into factors that humans are not in a position to even consider. Humans may in fact be living in the best possible world given God’s divine plans.

                  1.1.4.2.8.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                  But knowing that lots of people die everyday with depression this would mean that an all knowing god cannot create a world that all of its creations would be happy with. Thus god can not be all knowing.

          1.1.4.2.8.3. Con:
          -> See 1.1.4.2.8.2.1.1.1.

        1.1.4.2.9. Pro:
        God damns sinners to eternal torment in Hell. Torture is morally wrong. And eternal punishment is way out of proportion to finite sins.

        1.1.4.2.10. Con:
        If God is evil, there is left no explanation for the existence of good things.

          1.1.4.2.10.1. Con:
          If God is evil but not "perfectly evil" or "omnimalevolent", he may be pleased by the existence of good things for their own sake, even as he is also pleased to see good things corrupted and destroyed.

            1.1.4.2.10.1.1. Con:
            If a God who is both good and evil is a coherent concept, then God being evil as an objection to His existence evaporates entirely. If God can be evil, good, and exist, then there is no argument against God.

              1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1. Con:
              If God is as morally corrupt as the rest of us, that is an objection to his being the source of moral values and duties.

                1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1. Con:
                If God is both good and bad, this does not rule out God as the only viable source of objective moral values and duties. An alternative grounding would have to be provided.

                  1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                  P1. If God doesn’t exist, there is no basis or foundation for moral values.

                    1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    God, in his moral nature [217], is the paradigm of goodness. He is by nature essentially good, loving, kind, faithful, just, loyal, truthful, etc. Moral values are defined paradigmatically in God; that is to say, God is the standard.

                      1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                      Morality is an abstract principle, independent of God. If God can be said to be moral, it is only because He follows this principle, not because He causes it or is the source of it.

                        1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                        P1. Is something good because God wills it, or does God will something because it is good? If you say that something is good because God wills it, then what is good becomes arbitrary. But if you say that God wills something because it is good, then what is good or bad is independent of God. In that case, moral values and duties exist independently of God, which contradicts premise 1. (This is the Euthyphro dilemma)

                          1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          This is a false dilemma because there is a third alternative, namely, God wills something because He is good. God’s own nature is the standard of goodness, and His commandments to us are expressions of His nature. Our moral duties are determined by the commands of a just and loving God.

                            1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                            It is a true dilemma, and redefining "goodness" to be identical to "God's Nature" merely pushes it back a step: are the properties like loving-kindness, impartiality, and generosity (etc.) good because
                            1) God possesses them in His nature, or
                            2) does God possess them in His nature because they are good?
                            
                            Either side makes the Moral Argument untenable.

                              1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                              If (2), the good is a principle independent of God, so there is no reason to think that "If God does not exist, objective moral values and duties do not exist." and the Moral argument fails at P1. So it must be 1.

                              1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                              If (1), then it must be that
                              a) if God exists, wherever humans express these good properties can be called good and
                              b) if God does not exist, this exact same situation cannot be called good.
                              
                              (e.g. two humans' love for each other. This expression of love has the same basic motivations behind it, and the same effects on both parties if God exists or not.)
                              
                              Is it morally intuitive why case (a) is good and case (b) isn't? If we don't accept the validity of our moral intuitions, P2 fails.

By extension Nazis thought that resisting Nazis was immoral. Quite obviously most of the world would agree that the resistors were not acting immorally. The claim seems to suggest that we must all condemn the resistors as immoral, however all the grandparent demands is that Nazis condemn the resistors as immoral. The rest of humanity can make whatever moral judgement they wish.

The powerful are the moral ones because they simply have the ability to make it so. This is also a view that is morally repugnant. If a man overpowers his wife and keeps her trapped and chained in a dark basement until the day she dies, there is nothing morally wrong in his actions on this view. He is the one with physical power in his house and can therefore, make his wife do whatever he wishes.

One can as the parent suggest use their own moral sense to condemn a behavior, however that does not make it objective.

The training worked and so the students told their teacher, “we’ve decided that cheating is a value we want to hold.” The teacher replied, “cheating isn’t a value that I hold so in my class where I am in charge you can’t cheat.” As this example clearly illustrates, under socio-cultural relativism, “might makes right.”

The term right according to the grandparent is not even a coherent concept or at least not an objective one which is why the parent is misleading.

However if this is the case then calling that objective morality seems a stretch in the sense that the term morality loses its meaning. Instead of using the words morally good and right one could simply say godly and instead of using bad wrong and evil one could just say ungodly. Morality under this paradigm fails to hold onto any meaning of its own and is no longer a coherent concept.

                          The parent clearly states that good is with god and bad is against god. These terms are now at the very least unnecessary since godly and ungodly are more accurate and clear terms. They are then just synonyms with no disparate meaning. Due to the commonly interpreted meanings of morality the term becomes slightly misleading since it would no longer mean anything other than what god wants. One cannot ask why it is good to follow god or if it is good to follow god. Moral inquiry becomes pointless.

                      Creators do not have objective authority over their creations. This is true of inventors, but is perhaps better illustrated with literary criticism, where the concept has a widespread name - the Death of the Author [223]. The role of authorial intent remains disputed in those circles, but it is certainly no longer taken as prima facie true that authorial intent is the be-all and end-all of what a book or poem means.

                          Frodo will not be able to authoritatively redefine who Tolkien made him to be. Even if we imagine Frodo is a free creature that can make choices, Tolkien still imposes boundaries and limitations upon Frodo.

                          Frodo rejecting his purpose in the larger story does nothing to remove the purpose placed on him by Tolkien. Frodo can reject his purpose which will have implications for him and Tolkien’s world. But that doesn’t make Tolkien’s authority disappear. Tolkien could simply end Frodo’s life or place him in an eternally locked room from which there is no escape. Power and authority then reside with the author, not the subjects.

                        Irrelevant. Adding one more conscious mind, even a "big" one to the set of all other conscious minds, does not then make the big one the source of all moral value. The other conscious minds already had that.

It is not apparent that God has done so. The only way to assert that conscious minds are a source of purpose, significance, or moral value is to assume that an ultimate mind doesn't exist. This begs the question.

                      On this view, what is moral becomes whatever outcomes one defines as good. This means we'd have to accept the desired outcomes of the sociopath as good because that is how the sociopath defines them. There is no foundation or ground that we can stand upon to condemn them as wrong. This goes against our moral sense.

                      This still doesn’t provide a foundation for moral duties. Even if values like justice, loyalty, mercy, forbearance, and others just exist, this doesn’t result in any moral obligations for a person. On this view, moral vices like greed, hatred, and selfishness also presumably exist. Why shouldn’t a person align their life with these vices?

                      Moral properties, like goodness and badness, necessarily attach to certain natural states of affairs. Once the natural properties are in place, the moral properties necessarily come along with them. For example, the property of badness necessarily attaches to a man’s beating his wife. The property of goodness necessarily attaches to a mother’s nursing her infant.

                        If God doesn’t exist, it is improbable and strange that moral properties like goodness and badness even exist, much less somehow get necessarily attached to various natural states of affairs.

                    Without God, there is no authority to hold mankind accountable. Thus, whenever a moral value or related duty is suggested, one could always respond, "says who?" Thus, moral values and duties have no "teeth" without God to ultimately call mankind to account for their actions.

                      1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.9.1. Con:
                      An entity with power choosing to impose their values on others with rewards and punishments is the furthest thing from objectivity. This is no less true for a magical omnipotent "ultimate" authority than for a mere mortal authority such as a king setting down punishments for lese-majesty.

                      God may impose consequences for behaving or failing to behave in a certain way. But this cannot constitute a genuine duty, only an expectation and associated reward/punishment, like any sort of law. But moral duties hold independent of punishment or reward: one ought to do the right thing not because one will be rewarded, but because it is the right thing to do.

                        An expectation of reward or punishment is distinct from the actual action of being rewarded or punished. One may provide motivation to whom the rule is being imposed on. The other, however, is the actual act of justice for meeting or failing to meet the rule. Thus, without an authority administering justice, there is no real duty at all. Just a pseudo motivation to do what one has disillusioned themselves into thinking is one’s duty.

      1.1.4.3. Con:
      As only conscious minds can value things, moral values are necessarily subjective. Given the anatomical similarities of humans, some values may be universal (for humans) but that does not make them "objective". Moral duties follow from (among other things) moral values, so they cannot be objective either. Thus the argument fails at point 2.

      1.1.4.4. Con:
      The above definition of "Objective" is insufficient. The arbitrary opinion of any non-human mind would suffice as values "independent of human opinions". We could ask a chimpanzee, for example. There's no need for "God".

        1.1.4.4.1. Con:
        The opinion of other possible moral agents is irrelevant to the argument. If we find that objective moral values and duties exist as defined in the argument, then the conclusion is warranted. The opinion of other entities that we could never hope to understand perfectly (because we cannot become a different species) is irrelevant. Either we have a moral sense that tells us objective moral values and duties exist for the human race or we don't. We don't need a broader definition of "objective."

          1.1.4.4.1.1. Pro:
          Other moral agents could simply have their own objective moral values and duties that are specific to them and not to humans. The fact that these would be different from objective moral values and duties for humans poses not problem for the moral argument for God's existence. God, if He exists, may expect something entirely different from one type of moral agent to the next.

          1.1.4.4.1.2. Con:
          There aren't objective moral values. Moral values differ.

        1.1.4.4.2. Con:
        The definition in the parent is too restricted. It's not enough that there is an "external moral advice" to human mind. It has to be authoritative in order to ground moral duties. This does not leave many moral agents available.

      1.1.4.5. Con:
      This argument is If A, then B / B / therefore A. This is a fallacious argument (affirming the consequent).

        1.1.4.5.1. Con:
        The actual form of the argument is A—>B / -B / therefore -A. This is modus tollens [226].

      1.1.4.6. Con:
      Multiple Gods representing multiple moral codes have existed and continue to exist in various religions. By this argument, all of those Gods, many of which are mutually exclusive, can be said to exist.

      1.1.4.7. Con:
      Kant's categorical imperative [227] does not require God. If we wish a maxim were universally followed, and we follow it ourselves, we are acting morally. (This is not independent of human opinion, as it is based on human opinion.)

        1.1.4.7.1. Con:
        Kant's categorical imperative fails to provide a foundation for moral value because some individuals are sociopaths and wish to see harmful and destructive things become universal norms. On Kant's view, these must also be considered good.

        1.1.4.7.2. Con:
        -> See 1.1.4.2.10.1.1.1.1.1.

        1.1.4.7.3. Con:
        P1. If God doesn’t exist, there are no moral duties.

          1.1.4.7.3.1. Pro:
          A moral duty can only be owed to a person, an authority.

            1.1.4.7.3.1.1. Con:
            Duties result wholly and exclusively from the sense of dutifulness, as, lacking that, all that remains is a demand or expectation. As a sense of dutifulness can be directed toward persons and non-persons alike, moral duties (being a sort of duty) need not be "owed" to a person.

              1.1.4.7.3.1.1.1. Con:
              Duties directed towards non-persons are really just self-imposed duties. Self is still a person.

                1.1.4.7.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                It follows that duties need not involve any person other than oneself, and thus, would not need God.

                  1.1.4.7.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  This would count only for duties imposed on oneself. Oneself may be a proper authority for self-imposed duties (even if these happen to benefit others) but God as the provider of moral law is still necessary to affirm duties to Himself or others (thus making these duties objective). Bottom line is, no God, no one to stop you from choosing whatever you want to do for you. There is no authority to answer to.

          1.1.4.7.3.2. Pro:
          If God doesn’t exist, human beings are just animals, and animals have no moral obligations to one another. When a lion kills a zebra, this isn’t murder. When a great white shark forcibly copulates with a female, this isn’t rape. There is no moral dimension to these actions. They are neither prohibited nor obligatory.

            1.1.4.7.3.2.1. Con:
            Human beings are indeed animals, but it does not follow that by being animals we have no morality.  That is an unwarranted generalization. Indeed, other intelligent social animals have evolved basic moral instincts.

            1.1.4.7.3.2.2. Pro:
            If an animal does indeed have moral instincts, then they do nothing wrong when they violate these instincts.

              1.1.4.7.3.2.2.1. Con:
              Social animals who violate group norms may be punished by others in the group. This is because they wronged the others. It is the same with humans.

            1.1.4.7.3.2.3. Con:
            Humans are self-conscious animals, regardless of the existence of God. It is this self-consciousness which gives rise to morality, by the mirror principle (i.e. don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you).

          1.1.4.7.3.3. Con:
          If God doesn’t exist, moral actions such as rape and incest may not be biologically or socially advantageous and so in the course of human development have become taboo.

            1.1.4.7.3.3.1. Con:
            This does nothing to show that rape or incest is really wrong. Such behavior goes on all the time in the animal kingdom. The rapist who goes against the herd morality is doing nothing more serious than acting unfashionably, like the man who belches loudly at the dinner table.

          1.1.4.7.3.4. Con:
          There are secular objective moral systems.

            1.1.4.7.3.4.1. Pro:
            Morality could be a Platonic Form [228] that exists in its own right. But there is no reason to call this Form of Morality "God", and there are reasons not to.

              1.1.4.7.3.4.1.1. Pro:
              The Form is not a mind.

              1.1.4.7.3.4.1.2. Pro:
              The Form is not personal.

              1.1.4.7.3.4.1.3. Pro:
              The Form has no inherent power to act.

            1.1.4.7.3.4.2. Pro:
            John Rawls’s Social Contract theory [229] is objective, but does not require God.

            1.1.4.7.3.4.3. Pro:
            Railton’s Reductive Naturalism [230] is objective, but does not require God.

            1.1.4.7.3.4.4. Pro:
            Ideal Observer Theory [231] is objective, but does not require God.

            1.1.4.7.3.4.5. Pro:
            Morality "exists" objectively, just like the economy exists objectively. Morality could be an emergent property of a system of agents, just like the economy. If money "doesn't exist", why do you want it? This need not collapse into nihilism or relativism.

      1.1.4.9. Con:
      Moral reality could be based on what behavior is effective "for me/group/society to live (well) and reproduce". In this sence, moral reality itself is connected to physical world. (There is no need to be given extra)

      1.1.4.14. Con:
      P1. Atheists can be good without God.

        1.1.4.14.1. Con:
        Of course they can. In fact, there are some atheists of such fine moral quality that they would put theists to shame. However, this misunderstands the premise. The premise isn’t asserting that one must believe in God to live a moral life. It is saying that if God doesn’t exist, there are no such things as objective moral values and duties. Morality is an illusion.

      1.1.4.15. Con:
      P2. Moral values are a byproduct of biological evolution and social conditioning. There is no reason to think they are objective.

        1.1.4.15.1. Con:
        It doesn't square with moral experience. Human rights are not the results of social construct or else gay-rape is not objectively wrong, this is just a convention.

          1.1.4.15.1.1. Con:
          Gay-rape doesn't help to create more effective society, so it's bad. No need of "objective morals".

            1.1.4.15.1.1.1. Con:
            If the only reason that gay rape is wrong is because it doesn’t help create a more effective society, then it isn’t objectively wrong. The person who conducts it is simply acting unfashionably. But this idea is repulsive to our moral sense. Thus, gay rape is objectively morally wrong.

              1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1. Con:
              If something is repulsive to your moral sense, it doesn't automatically mean that it is objectively wrong. Eating other people could be repulsive to many, but quite normal for others.

                1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                Intuition is not a very accurate source of information. Intuition gave us great ideas like that the sun revolves around the earth, the earth is flat, that meat spontaneously generated flies among other fallacies. Intuition evolved to help us survive, such as a mothers intuition about her baby, intuitions about what animals are dangerous and about what plants are poisonous. Intuition's track record when it comes to more abstract and complicated concepts unrelated to our survival is not very good.

                  1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Intuition is the the ability to understand something immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. Thus, intuition is not what is being advocated for. Rather the moral argument says we have a moral sense that enables us to perceive objective moral values and duties and gives clear examples.

                    1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    Either the moral sense is an intuition or the belief that what it perceives is objective is an intuition. Either it is being claimed that our moral sense needs no conscious reasoning to back up or it is being stated that the objectivity of this sense is obvious and intuitive. Either way this argument is intuition based and intuition is not infallible.

                1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                We, as society, decide whether something is acceptable or not. It is not a short term decision, but of many years/centuries. (it could be changed very quickly though, but it would be a short change, as it was during world war II)

                  1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3. Con:
                  If socio-cultural relativism is true, then there is no such thing as moral improvement and people who advocate for moral change like Martin Luther King are immoral for going against the agreed morality of society. This our moral sense finds repugnant.

                    1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3.1. Con:
                    There is moral improvement in socio-cultural relativism. One does not exclude the other.

                      1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3.1.1. Con:
                      Under relativism any such improvement would be subjective and so some may find it an improvement while others disagree. 200 years down the line the new majority view might be that it was not improvement at all. The phrase moral improvement seems to become rather meaningless at that point.

                    1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3.2. Con:
                    Shifts in moral values are conceivable within socio-cultural relativism. Morals change, and these changes may be viewed, within the culture, as for the better or for the worse.

                    1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3.3. Con:
                    The claim says this goes against our moral sense. This seems to imply that everyone has the same moral sense. Some people in Dr. Kings time no doubt thought that what he was doing was immoral. According to the parent their moral sense was wrong and "ours" is right. Right now many find Gay marriage to be against their moral sense. Many others disagree. Whose moral sense is right, whose is objective? Moral sense is clearly not uniform or objective.

                      1.1.4.15.1.1.1.1.2.3.3.1. Con:
                      The parent is irrelevant as the grandparent’s point was that moral improvement in society is not possible on socio-cultural relativism. This has not been addressed.

        1.1.4.15.2. Pro:
        If some behaviour help for society to work more efficient (survive and reproduce), it is "good". There is no need for external entity do define it.

        1.1.4.15.3. Con:
        This does nothing to undermine the truth of moral beliefs. The truth of a belief is independent of how one comes to hold that belief.

          1.1.4.15.3.1. Pro:
          You may have acquired your moral beliefs through a fortune cookie or by reading tea leaves, and they could still happen to be true.

          1.1.4.15.3.2. Pro:
          If God exists, then objective moral values and duties do exist regardless of how we come to learn about them.

            1.1.4.15.3.2.1. Con:
            Even if God did exist, morality would still be subjective, he would just be an exceptionally powerful individual with his own opinions on what is moral, like a President or Dictator.

          1.1.4.15.3.3. Pro:
          At best, biological evolution (if true) and social conditioning prove that our perception of moral values and duties has evolved. But if moral values are gradually discovered, not invented, then our gradual and fallible perception of those values no more undermines their objective reality than our gradual, fallible perception of the physical world undermines its objective reality.

          1.1.4.15.3.4. Con:
          Biological evolution and social conditioning don’t undermine the truth of moral belief, but rather human justification for holding such beliefs. We can’t trust our moral experience and therefore don’t know if premise 2 is true.

            1.1.4.15.3.4.1. Pro:
            If your moral beliefs were based on reading tea leaves, they might accidentally turn out to be true, but you wouldn’t have any justification for thinking that they are true. So you wouldn’t know that they are true.

            1.1.4.15.3.4.2. Pro:
            If our moral beliefs have been shaped by evolution, then we can’t have any confidence in them because evolution aims, not at truth, but at survival.

              1.1.4.15.3.4.2.1. Con:
              There is a distinction between intuitive pre-theoretic ideas which may be shaped by evolution, and theoretic reason-based ideas.

            1.1.4.15.3.4.3. Con:
            Apart from assuming God doesn’t exist, we have no reason to deny what our moral experience tells us.

              1.1.4.15.3.4.3.1. Con:
              There is huge variation in purported moral experience. That level of disagreement is a reason to distrust experience as a source.

                1.1.4.15.3.4.3.1.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.4.1.1.

                1.1.4.15.3.4.3.1.2. Con:
                The level of disagreement we see in moral experience is irrelevant to the existence of objective morals that exist apart from human opinion. The moral argument does not put forward that everyone recognizes the same morals, only that there are some values and duties that are objectively right or wrong.

              1.1.4.15.3.4.3.2. Con:
              One does not have to assume God doesn't exist to be sceptical of objective moral values. (For example, one could be agnostic about God, or sceptical of a God. Neither of these are the assumption God doesn't exist.)

            1.1.4.15.3.4.4. Con:
            This objection is self-defeating. Given the truth of naturalism, ALL our beliefs, not just our moral beliefs, are the result of evolution and social conditioning. Thus, the evolutionary account leads to skepticism about knowledge in general. This includes the parent claim.

              1.1.4.15.3.4.4.1. Con:
              Naturalism doesn't necessarily lead to the conclusion human beliefs are formed irrationally.

                1.1.4.15.3.4.4.1.1. Con:
                Wonderful, Then there is no reason to doubt our moral experience under naturalism. Thus the grandparent claim is false.

      1.1.4.16. Con:
      Under the definition, "objective" is defined as independent of opinions. However, the "objective" morality it purports to conclude doesn't fit that criteria, as it is contingent on a particular opinion.

        1.1.4.16.1. Con:
        The argument does not define "objective" as "independent of opinions." It defines it as "independent of human opinion." The point of P1 is to say that without God as the authority to ground objective moral values and duties, they don't exist.

          1.1.4.16.1.1. Con:
          There is no need for God to ground them, if they are grounded without God.

          1.1.4.16.1.2. Con:
          It is special pleading to make "human opinion" the definition of "subjective", instead of opinion in general.

      1.1.4.17. Con:
      P1. It is unknown whether God would actually be perfectly good or perfectly evil (as making such a distinction relies on moral knowledge independent of God). Therefore we do not know if God can ground morality.

        1.1.4.17.1. Con:
        Even if God was evil, his will is a sufficient ground for objective human morality.

        1.1.4.17.3. Con:
        Unless we are nihilists, we have to recognize some ultimate standard of value, and God is the least arbitrary stopping point.

      -> See 1.1.4.7.3.4.

      1.1.4.19. Con:
      The concept of an 'objective value' may be an oxymoron. Values depend on opinions, else we are talking about facts.

        -> See 1.1.4.16.1.

      1.1.4.20. Con:
      P2.Values are either personally subjective (e.g. 'I like dogs more than cats') or deontically subjective (i.e. exist within a system; e.g. money has value inside economic narratives). The moral argument is contingent on objective morality, and therefore fails.

        1.1.4.20.1. Con:

      1.1.4.21. Con:
      If there are certain moral behaviors that are true regardless of human opinion, then that would make them true in every area of the universe, regardless if we existed or not. If humans did not exist, we have no reason in believing that it would still be true to treat others well. This makes morality subjective since it isn't universally true.

        1.1.4.21.1. Con:
        If humans didn’t exist, they would have no reason for believing anything at all, much less that they have moral duties. Beings that don’t exist don’t believe anything. Pointing this out is trivial.

        1.1.4.21.2. Con:
        If God exists and decided not to create humans, then objective moral values would still be grounded in God’s nature by necessity. Therefore, human existence has nothing to do with the existence of objective moral values.

    1.1.5. Pro:
    We may be the objects in a computer simulation or computer game executed by God.

      1.1.5.1. Con:
      If we're sims, then we are patterns, not substance and this fails to account for the possibility that any given observer-moment has been simulated multiple times by possibly different beings. Since we're patterns and not souls, there's no fact of the matter about which "one" you are. Any interventions by the simulators would only affect one simulation, so statistically you should not expect to observe any miracles. I.e. they have no power to affect us. Why then, should we call any simulator God?

        1.1.5.1.1. Pro:
        Bostrom's Simulation Argument [232] supposes that, "The fraction of all people with our kind of experiences that are living in a simulation is very close to one", IF simulated realities far outnumber the base reality. (Otherwise we probably aren't simulations.)

      1.1.5.2. Con:
      Even if they present with all the properties of classical theism in relation to our universe, a programmer (or entire civilization) running a universe in simulation does not have God-like traits in objective reality, so they cannot be God.

    1.1.6. Pro:
    There is the possibility of an infinitude of Creators.

      1.1.6.1. Con:
      A complex mind is even less likely by Occam's razor.
      
      Every conjunctive necessarily reduces the probability. (Burdensome details [233]). The simplest explanation is more likely the correct one. Unfortunately, the naiive reasoner might not understand "simplest". E.g. the "simplest" explanation for anything is "That lady down the street is a witch, she did it." [234]
      
      But witches are not "simple". And neither is "God".

        1.1.6.1.2. Con:
        A mind is the only plausible explanation. All other explanations would either exist as a part of the universe and therefore require an explanation, or wouldn’t stand in causal relationships because they are abstract. Therefore, Occams’s razor doesn’t apply because there is no simpler explanation available that is plausible.

          Argument from ignorance./"You can't explain that" fallacy. That we do not know the explanation doesn't make it proper to assume "God did it". [235]

            1.1.6.1.2.4.1. Con:
            It is not an argument from ignorance to say that out of all the options we know of that could stand as an explanation of the universe’s existence, a mind is the most plausible entity.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.1.2. Con:
              It's a mysterious answer to a mysterious question [236]. It's like a physician "explaining" the power of a soporific by saying that it contains a "dormitive potency". Mystery is a property of questions, not answers. If the answer is still mysterious, then it has not answered the question.

                1.1.6.1.2.4.1.2.1. Pro:
                The "explanation" acts as a curiosity-stopper [237] rather than an anticipation-controller [238].

                1.1.6.1.2.4.1.2.2. Pro:
                The "explanation" has no moving parts--the model is not a specific complex mechanism, but a blankly solid substance or force. It's a black box.

            1.1.6.1.2.4.2. Pro:
            The Bayesian prior probability of the hypothesis "The God did it" for anything attributed to a particular monotheistic "God" is less than (<) the hypothesis
             "some god(s) did it" < "some kind of magical creature(s) did it" < "Poof! Magic" < "hallucination" < "someone lied or confabulated".
            
            Thus "God" is a highly specific claim and an extremely unlikely hypothesis for anything, requiring an unmet burden of finding equally unlikely evidence [239] not better explained by alternatives, to prove Him.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.1. Pro:
              Because the set of "some god or gods" includes any particular "God", its prior probability cannot be less than "The God did it", for some particular God.

                1.1.6.1.2.4.2.1.1. Con:
                The parent is little more than conjecture because it doesn’t consider the bodies of evidence for and against monotheism/polytheism. It is a hasty generalization.

                  1.1.6.1.2.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  It does not matter what the bodies of evidence are. The probability that one of X gods exists is less than or equal to the probability that at least one of X gods exists or that some god exists. 
                  P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 
                  P(A and B) = P(B|A)*P(A) = P(A|B)*P(B)
                  P(B|A) <= 1 
                  P(A|B) <= 1
                  P(A and B) <= min(P(B),P(A)) 
                  P(A or B) <= P(B) + P(A) - min(P(B),P(A)) 
                   P(A or B) >= P(B) and P(A or B) >= P(A)

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.2. Pro:
              Because gods are (usually) defined as magical (i.e. supernatural/paranormal/miraculous) anthropomorphic immortals, they are included in the set "some kind of magical creature", thus the prior probability of "some kind of magical creature(s) did it" cannot be less than "some god(s) did it".

                1.1.6.1.2.4.2.2.1. Con:
                The parent is little more than conjecture because it doesn’t consider the bodies of evidence for polytheism vs magical creatures. It is a hasty generalization.

                  1.1.6.1.2.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
                  The argument is about priors [240], not posteriors [241]. The order of explanations necessarily falls out of the relative sizes of the sets of explanations in question. 
                  
                  Now, in a particular case, an unlikely explanation on priors may turn out be true, but it takes equally unlikely evidence [242] to prove it. That's not a pointless bureaucratic regulation, it's math.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.3. Pro:
              Because "Poof! Magic" is an unspecified magical force, its prior probability cannot be less than a more particular source of magic like "some kind of magical creature(s)".

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.4. Pro:
              Because hallucinations are actually known to exist in the real world to scientific standards (it's a replicable experiment, just take LSD), but magic is not known to exist despite scientific testing, the prior probability of any magical experience being due to magic is far below the probability of it being a hallucination.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.5. Pro:
              Because hallucinations, while a well-documented phenomena, require special circumstances (like a schizotypal personality disorder [243], hallucinogenic drugs, brain tumors, fasting/exhaustion or certain meditation practices, etc.) and people lie/confabulate/exaggerate all the time, the prior probability of lies are much higher than of hallucinations.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.6. Con:
              Concluding a designer does not conclude a monotheistic God is responsible for the fine tuning of the universe. However, a designer would be consistent with monotheism and other forms of theism.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.7. Con:
              Pointing out various hypotheses that would be consistent with a designer does nothing to reduce design as a plausible explanation of the fine tuning of the universe.

                1.1.6.1.2.4.2.7.1. Con:
                It demonstrates that the prior odds of the Designer hypothesis are low. It's an extraordinary claim [244], which requires extraordinary evidence [245].

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.8. Con:
              The order of the explanations above is little more than conjecture. The various justifications present simplistic comparisons of the various hypotheses thus failing to address or incorporate bodies of evidence for or against each hypothesis. Thus the order in which the hypotheses are arranged seem to be based on arbitrary individual interpretation.

              1.1.6.1.2.4.2.9. Con:
              The order of explanations given above is a generalized dismissal of “God explanations” that doesn’t consider the evidence attempting to be explained.  This list could look drastically different if the body of evidence considered changes. Thus, it is useless to think about the order of these hypotheses without considering first the evidence to be explained.

                  This argument, rather than engaging with the arguments for God’s existence or discussing what counts as warranted belief in God, seeks to dismiss belief in the thesis “God exists” by explaining how it originated. Thus, this argument commits the genetic [246] fallacy.

                    Pure deductive logic only works in axiomatic systems. In the real world, we have to use inductive reasoning, from the particular to the general case. Demanding that deductive rules be followed for inductive arguments is an error.

                      There are no inductive arguments that support, "in the real world, we have to use inductive reasoning." Therefore, the parent is self-defeating.

                        The inductive argument for induction working in the real world, is that there are many examples that induction works in the real world (and not using induction doesn't work), and by induction we can generalize the principle that in the real world, we have to use inductive reasoning. Thus, an inductive argument for using inductive arguments in the real world exists proving the parent claim false by counterexample.

                          The grandparent asserts that we HAVE to use inductive reasoning. This denies all deductive reasoning and a priori truth. There is no inductive argument that would lead to the conclusion we HAVE to use inductive reasoning. Indeed, the reliability of inductive reasoning itself is established on a priori truths.

                            1.1.6.1.2.4.2.10.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                            Bayesian inference is the fundamental basis of any agent capable of inductive learning--i.e. anything intelligent. It does not deny deduction at all, as deduction is a special case of Bayesian inference when applied to propositions of high probability.

                            One must learn to talk before they can do "a priori [248]" reasoning. But you can't learn to talk from a dictionary, which has only circular definitions. You must use inference. Thus, in the real world, we do have to use inductive reasoning before [249] we can use deductive reasoning.

                              The order in which reasoning is used is irrelevant. This doesn’t change the reality that we can use deductive reasoning to arrive at knowledge and that some knowledge is a priori.

                      To state that a conclusion doesn’t necessarily follow from the inductive evidence is not “demanding that deductive rules be followed.” The great grandparent concluded something. The conclusion didn’t follow from the evidence. Thus it is a weak inductive argument.

                It's true that priors change over time in this fashion, but what one's initial prior should have been is something one must also re-assess over time; otherwise you're tied to the first impressions you had of an idea. As such, an argument for how low the prior for God should be before encountering any evidence is still useful.

              These Bayesian priors will look vastly different from individual to individual and depend on a persons upbringing, experiences, and natural intuitions. For example, if one is taught by their parents that God exists and magic isn't a thing, their prior probability will be vastly different from the list above. Or perhaps one believes in God based on mans natural inclination to believe in God. Their prior probability for the hypothesis, "God explains it" will be higher than otherwise.

Thus belief in God is not arbitrary; it is grounded by the appropriate circumstances and so is properly basic.

        Whether the theory of evolution is true or not it demonstrates a way for intelligent creatures and natural creatures to arise without the need for a designer.

              The teleological argument never claims to only be applicable to monotheism.

            1.1.7.1.1.1.9. Con:
            The parent is an attempt to shift the burden of proof to one who rejects a designer. It provides no reason to think a designer is real other than that it is natural for us to think this way. It is likewise natural for us to think the earth is the center of the universe and the planets revolve around it and that the earth is flat. A naturally occurring belief justified by nothing besides it being naturally formed is not justified and thus the burden of proof is on the one who made the claim.

                  I think you are missing the point of my argument. In the debate between intelligent design and non-intelligent design the essential question is "regarding nature are things designed by an intelligence or not?"
                  
                  We don't know the answer to that we only know that complexity exists in nature. However, we do know that less complicated things such as technology are the direct result of intelligent design. 
                  
                  Therefore, we have examples of intelligent design but not its opposite.

        Even if we grant that 13 billion years isn't enough time for abiogenesis in our entire Hubble volume, this neglects to account for the size of the universe outside that volume. In a sufficiently large universe, random abiogenesis *somewhere* is inevitable. And, of course, being alive ourselves, we'd have to find ourselves in one of those rare locations.

        Abiogenesis suggests that organised proteins, molecules & amino acids progress in an orderly manner towards an "inevitable" goal of more complex structure. The initial formation of molecules into the simplest virus from nothing requires a complexity of its own that renders no amount of space or time possible for it to come about without external orderly force. Unless you call abiogenesis God. inevitability would suggest that sooner or later life would come from nowhere, a false premise.

Closely related humans have more insertion points [277] in common than distantly related humans. And chimpanzees have more of these in common with humans than the lower primates.

                    That's not how evidence works. [279] There are rules. [280] Fact F is evidence for hypothesis H only if F is more likely in worlds with H and F is less likely in worlds without H. If F is equally likely given H or ~H, then F is not evidence for (or against) H.
                    
                    Since the Creator could have designed life with a variety of designs, but a common ancestor could not have caused this, by conservation of evidence, the fact of commonality is evidence for common descent, and not for the Creator.

                      The parent makes little sense. Facts are supposedly indisputable. What does it mean for F to be “less likely?” Hypotheses are what we are trying to prove with facts. It should read, “Fact F is evidence for hypothesis H only if H is more likely in worlds with F and H is less likely in worlds without F.” The “fact of commonality” (F) would be evidence for the hypothesis that “God used previous designs to make new designs” (H) to create new designs. If not F, this would not support H.

                Yet no one can show any convincing evidence that these transitional forms are really intermediary fossils. That would require millions of fossils that demonstrate one transition to the next through very small adjustments. It is all inferred and extrapolated in reverse from existing observations of now. It is mere conjecture.

                    The particular proof fallacy is not a real fallacy. The best that can be said for fossil evidence is that it is possibly consistent with the common ancestor hypothesis if these connections between various species (which are made largely by conjecture) are actually true. Given the insufficient number of transitional forms, it is far from clear the burden of proof required has been met.

Conducting a survey of the paleontological literature, one would find that there is "abundant evidence [288] for how all the major groups of animals are related, much of it in the form of excellent transitional fossils

                  1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1. Con:
                  Transitional form doesn’t mean “an intermediate form between some earlier form and a later form observed today.” A transitional form is simply an organism that exhibits features of different types of organisms. [289] For example, the Archaeopteryx is called a transitional form because it exhibits avian features (of birds) and reptilian features. So in that sense it is transitional. But, in fact, it is not really transitional in the sense of being an intermediate form.

                    1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.1. Con:
                    This is in fact not the definition of transitional form. "Fossils or organisms that show the intermediate states between an ancestral form and that of its descendants are referred to as transitional forms." This definition [290] provided by Berkley rather than reasonable faith would seem more credible as a scientific definition.

                      1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
                      The official definition is not in dispute. Dr. Craig is simply pointing out a sense in which these forms aren’t literally transitional. Scientists make a best guess which is largely conjecture.

                        1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        Except that in the great grandparent it is stated that the species are not actually intermediate a claim which has no basis in fact. Many studies performed on the fossils lead scientists to conclude that they are intermediate forms. Dr. Craig being skeptical is not a crime but trying to undermine the studies and the science and the definitions in an effort to mislead one into dismissing the evidence is not justified.

                    1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.2. Con:
                    Through many studies scientists have come to think that Archeaeopteryx [291] is either a close relative of the ancestor of modern birds or the common ancestor itself and that it does in fact represent at the very least a very good approximation of an intermediate in between dinosaurs and birds.

                      1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.2.1. Con:
                      It is not disputed that Archeaeopteryx is defined as an intermediate form. Dr. Craig simply points out it is not in line with modern birds. It simply dies out [292]. In this sense, it isn’t really transitional.

                        1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.1.2.1.1. Con:
                        It does not simply die out. It stops showing up in the fossil record. Studies suggest that Archeaeopeteryx is either an ancestor or a close relative of the ancestor of modern birds. So there was a fork in which two populations emerged and one evolved eventually into birds and the other became Archeaeopeteryx or it was that which they emerged from. In the latter case it is literally transitional and Dr. Craig would be wrong. In the former case it would be very close to the true transitional form.

                  1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2. Con:
                  If the thesis of common ancestry were correct, we are not talking about there being a few transitional forms like Archaeopteryx. Rather there should be literally millions and millions [293] of these transitional forms in the fossil record. Think, for example, of all of the intermediate forms that would have to exist in order for a bat and a whale to have descended from a common ancestor. And yet, they are not there.

                    1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1. Con:
                    Evolution of whales [294] is a particularly bad example we do in fact have many intermediate fossils showing how the ancestors of whales walked on land.

                      1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1. Con:
                      We have many intermediate fossils showing similar features of two different animals. We don’t have any conclusive proof that any of these were direct transitional forms from one animal to the next. Based on the evolutionary tree [295], these species just seem to die out or endure, not transition into another species.

                        1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
                        This is simply untrue the site [296] the parent links to shows a clear progression of one group disappearing and then the next showing up in the record with a unidirectional progression of the animals becoming more and more aquatic.

                          1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          The point is that the fossil data could be used to support both natural and supernatural design hypotheses. We have fossils in the record that we have dated for certain times. The connections made between these fossils, while based on sound methods and therefore not conducted arbitrarily, are largely conjecture because they are based on insufficient data. We do not have the millions of fossils necessary to demonstrate that this is a completely natural process.

                              1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                              God’s existence and role as a designer is not an unjustified assumption. It is a warranted position built on evidence. Many people believe and argue that it is more justifiable than believing the universe is an illusion, eternal, self-existent, popped into existence randomly, or through natural means produced all that we experience in reality today.

Maybe Russell had an alien informant or something. But that's not enough to overcome its low prior. There are numerous real-world claims based on similarly flimsy evidence. Like Homeopathy.

Inside the universe, we know of processes that increase complexity, order and size without power or personal agency e.g. biological evolution.
                                                The argument does not lead to a changeless cause, either; it is coherent to think of an object or state of existence that uses itself up to create the universe.

Thus efficiency is not an issue when you have infinite resources to accomplish your aim. The same could be true with the designer of the universe.

Design would be consistent with the existence of a supernatural god and thus it is appropriate to use the teleological argument in a collective case for God's existence.

                      We can conclude they share characteristics. This does not lead to, they shared a common ancestor. You would need millions of transitional forms to demonstrate this.

                        1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.2.1.1. Con:
                        There are other forms of evidence such as DNA analysis for example. The point is that the standard of evidence demanded by the parent is far more than one would ever demand in any other case. Nothing short of a time machine would ever prove anything by this standard.

                          1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                          The evidence is consistent with the design hypothesis. If there is a designer, it is completely within the realm of a designer to use previous blueprints to design new creatures. The fossil evidence required to rule out this hypothesis would be millions of intermediate fossils.

                    It would be nice if there were millions and millions of fossils, but fossils do not always keep not everything that has ever lived is turned into a fossil and the vast majority of fossils have not and likely never will be found since we do not dig literally everywhere. It is simply ridiculous to expect millions and millions. We have already found many [327] and if punctuated equilibrium [328] is true we will likely only find an abundance of fossils in between large groups not small ones anyways.

                      1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.3.1. Pro:
                      The parent is true. Therefore, we will never have sufficient evidence from the fossil record to prove transitional forms are in fact intermediate fossils. All we have is conjecture, hopes, and guesses.

              1.1.7.3.5.1.1.5. Con:
              Not one common ancestor has ever been discovered--only proposed.  LUCA included.  Read carefully this LUCA article [331] .  It is peppered with terminology to indicate that this is speculated. Nothing has been found to use as actual evidence.

            Speciation has been observed scientifically [334].

              1.1.7.3.5.1.2.1. Con:
              Speciation is not necessarily evidence of evolution. Any real evolution (macroevolution) requires an expansion of the gene pool [335], the addition of new genes (genons) with new information for new traits as life is supposed to move from simple beginnings to ever more varied and complex forms (“molecules to man” or “fish to philosopher”). This has not been observed.

                1.1.7.3.5.1.2.1.1. Con:
                There is no recognized distinction between macro-evolution [336] and micro-evolution this is an unscientific invention since they are identical processes occurring on differing scales.

                1.1.7.3.5.1.2.1.2. Con:
                There are many ways changes in DNA can alter phenotypes and introduce variation into a population without the introduction of new genes [337]. Modulating gene expression [338] can alter phenotypes without introducing new genes. As can mutations in preexisting genes. The combining of preexisting genes can also create new effects.

                1.1.7.3.5.1.2.1.3. Con:
                Transposons [339] can create mutations which introduce variation. They can also by moving change and create new genetic sequences which can get transcribed into RNA and then translated into proteins which would in effect make them new genes. This actually has been observed [340] multiple times.

              1.1.7.3.5.1.2.2. Pro:

              Equivocation, specifically the "only a theory" fallacy commonly heard from the anti-science crowd. A scientific theory is a repeatedly testable coherent model of a system [343]. It is NOT a conjecture or hypothesis as the parent implies. Evolution is a thoroughly proven theory. One might as easily say "the theory of gravity is just a theory" or "the germ theory of disease is just a theory".

                1.1.7.3.5.1.3.3.1. Con:

        Could complex things such as computers, cars, airplanes, buildings, etc., come into existence without man’s involvement (i.e., evolve) within say millions of years? Intuitively this appears unlikely - these complex things should have an intelligent maker. Could the more complex objects of nature, e.g., humans, have simply evolved without a Maker/God? This should appear even more unlikely.

        1.1.7.3.9. Con:
        It is not the case that complexity is the hallmark of design: simplicity is. The absence of redundant features to reach a purpose is suggestive of design.

          1.1.7.3.9.1. Con:
          The more complex something is, the more obvious it has a designer. For example, a car's engine needs far more intelligence than a ramp. Both are designed, but there is a way more obvious and higher level of thinking with the design of the engine. Complexity requires several simple systems to work cohesively in inventive and interesting ways.

            1.1.7.3.9.1.1. Con:
            Engines are not intelligent, they are complex. That complexity arises from simplicity is a common observation, just as entropy is. Neither imply deity.

              1.1.7.3.9.1.1.1. Con:
              This fails to distinguish between ordered complexity and specified complexity. [345] Specified complexity combines high improbability with an independent given pattern.

      2. It is not due to physical necessity or chance.

      Fine Tuning Means: Small deviations from the actual values of the constants (e.g. G in Newton’s law of gravity which is expressed F = Gm1m2/r2) and quantities (e.g. entropy level) in question would render the universe life-prohibiting.

        1.1.7.4.3. Con:
        The changes necessary are much larger than Craig usually claims.

        1.1.7.4.4. Con:
        Deviations to a single constant that may be life-prohibiting are no longer life-prohibiting if other constants may also change. There may be a wide range in the space of possible constants that permit life. That we happen to exist at a single point in such a range is not surprising.

          1.1.7.4.4.1. Con:
          The parent misrepresent the argument and is a strawman. The argument grants this is possible and still holds that it is overwhelmingly  more probable that a life-prohibiting universe would exist than one that is life-permitting.

            1.1.7.4.4.1.1. Con:
            Craig is far underestimating [347]the diversity of possible life-forms. The truth is, he has no idea how wide the life-permitting range is.

              1.1.7.4.4.1.1.1. Con:
              By life, the argument means that property of organisms to take in food, extract energy from it, grow, adapt to their environment, and reproduce. For the universe to permit life (so defined), whatever form organisms might take, the constants and quantities have to be incomprehensibly fine-tuned. In the absence of fine-tuning, not even atomic matter or chemistry would exist, not to speak of planets where life might evolve!

            1.1.7.4.4.1.2. Con:
            Probabilities must be drawn from some distribution. There is no reason to assume that all possible values of said constants are equiprobable.

              1.1.7.4.4.1.2.1. Con:
              One can create a distribution by adjusting the constants and quantities by tiny intervals and mapping them on a sheet of paper. Life permitting universes could be red dots. Life prohibiting universe could be blue. What you would have is a few red dots in a sea of blue. It is in this sense that life-permitting universes are improbable.

          1.1.7.4.4.2. Pro:

            "You know, the most amazing thing happened to me tonight. I was coming here, on the way to the lecture, and I came in through the parking lot. And you won't believe what happened. I saw a car with the license plate ARW 357. Can you imagine? Of all the millions of license plates in the state, what was the chance that I would see that particular one tonight? Amazing!"
            --Richard Feynman

              1.1.7.4.4.2.1.1. Pro:
              The probability of seeing those numbers is, of course, quite low. But this is true no matter what license plate number one observes, and unless it has an independently defined significance, this probability is meaningless. Thus, the example commits the texas sharpshooter fallacy [348].

          1.1.7.4.4.3. Con:
          By “life,” the argument means that property of organisms to take in food, extract energy from it, grow, adapt to their environment and reproduce. In order for the universe to permit life so defined, whatever form organisms might take, the constants and quantities have to be incomprehensibly fine-tuned.

        1.1.7.4.6. Con:
        The so-called "constants" may be contingent upon factors that vary with time and place. The fact that we observe "constants" compatible with human life would necessarily follow from the fact that humans can only be found in such a time and place. This is the Weak Anthropic Principle.

          1.1.7.4.6.1. Pro:
          The acceleration due to gravity is 9.8 m/s/s. Unless you're on the moon, then it's 1.6 m/s/s. What is commonly known as "constant" on Earth, is not the same elsewhere. Similarly we do not know how far the physical constants hold, just that violations of some of them have not yet been observed. But there are reasons to think they might vary. [349]

            1.1.7.4.6.1.1. Con:
            The parent is not an example of a universal constant. A true example would be a simple law like Newton’s law of gravity F = Gm1m2/r2. According to this law, the gravitational force F between two objects depends not just on their respective masses m1 and m2 and the distance between them r, but also on a certain quantity G which is constant regardless of the masses and distance.
            
            These are the types of constants under consideration and apply to the entirety of the universe.

              1.1.7.4.6.1.1.1. Con:
              They might not apply to the entire universe. See String theory landscape [350]

          1.1.7.4.6.2. Con:
          This argument is based on confusion. It confuses the true claim:
          
          A. If observers who have evolved within a universe observe its constants and quantities, it is highly probable that they will observe them to be fine-tuned for their existence.
          
          with the false claim
          
          A'. It is highly probable that a universe exist which is finely tuned for the evolution of observers within it.

            1.1.7.4.6.2.1. Pro:
            An observer who has evolved within the universe should regard it as highly probable that he will find the constants and quantities of the universe fine-tuned for his existence; but he should not infer that it is therefore highly probable that such a fine-tuned universe exist.

        Despite the title, this is not an argument for God's existence, just for Intelligent Design, thus it does not support the thesis "God Exists".

          1.1.7.4.8.1. Con:
          It is true the argument doesn’t provide direct evidence for the proposition, “God exists.” However, since it is evidence for a Designer of the cosmos, it provides corroborative evidence for the thesis, “God exists.”

          1.1.7.4.8.2. Pro:
          The intelligent designer(s) might not be anything recognized as God by theists.

        1.1.7.4.9. Con:
        It would be impossible to formulate this claim in any other world but that which is able to sustain life as we know it. As such, it is a matter of chance, not purpose.

          1.1.7.4.9.1. Con:

        1.1.7.4.10. Pro:
        Complex things, e.g., watches, computers, cars, airplanes, buildings, etc., are made by man using intelligence. Could they come into existence without man’s involvement (i.e., evolve) within say millions of years? Intuitively this appears unlikely - these complex things should have an intelligent maker. Living things, e.g., human beings, & other objects of nature are evidently more complex. Could they have simply evolved without a Maker/God? This should appear even more unlikely.

        1.1.7.4.11. Pro:
        Fine tuning, according to many physicists [352], is the fact that the universe’s ability to support life depends delicately on various fundamental characteristics, notably on the form of the laws of nature, on the values of some constants of nature, and on aspects of the universe’s conditions in its very early stages.

        1.1.7.4.12. Pro:
        P1: Premise 1 seems to exhaust the alternatives. If someone can think of another alternative, then he is free to suggest it. In the absence of a specific suggestion, however, we are justified in thinking that (1) includes all the alternatives, since necessity and chance seem to exhaust the alternatives to design.

          1.1.7.4.12.1. Con:
          Ignoring the argument from ignorance fallacy, we could easily posit other explanations for the values of the constants. Its possible they are NOT free to change, and that no 'fine tuning' is even possible. It could be that their values are defined by some other, as yet undiscovered, physical laws that constrain their values to those we can measure today.

            1.1.7.4.12.1.1. Con:
            There is no fallacy. If there was, we’d have to disregard all sorts of knowledge for in seeking truth, we evaluate lists of alternatives all the time that appear exhaustive. These do not give us qualms, nor should a list of evaluative options related to fine tuning.

            1.1.7.4.12.1.2. Con:
            The examples in the parent would be appeals to necessity as an explanation for the fine tuning of the universe.

            1.1.7.4.12.1.3. Con:
            Even if a different physical law will be discovered that constrains the values of other constants to their current values, that law itself will have to be finely tuned such that it constrains other physical constants to life-permitting ranges.

        1.1.7.4.13. Con:
        If the constants and quantities had assumed different values, then other forms of life might well have evolved.

          1.1.7.4.13.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.4.4.3.

          1.1.7.4.13.2. Con:
          In the absence of fine-tuning, not even atomic matter or chemistry would exist.

        1.1.7.4.14. Con:
        In universes governed by different laws of nature, life permitting universes might result from varying values of constants and quantities.

          1.1.7.4.14.1. Con:
          That is correct. However, such universes are irrelevant to the argument. Among possible universes governed by the same equations (but having different values of the constants and quantities) as the actual universe, life-permitting universes are extraordinarily improbable.

        1.1.7.4.17. Con:
        P3. One is not justified in inferring design as the best explanation of the complex order of the universe because then a new problem arises: who designed the designer?

          1.1.7.4.17.1. Con:
          If the monotheistic God in question is the one described in the Bible, then He is eternal and therefore not Himself created or designed. “Who designed the designer” is therefore not a problem.

            1.1.7.4.17.1.1. Con:
            Special pleading. If God can be uncreated/undesigned/eternal then the simpler hypothesis is that the universe can be uncreated/undesigned/eternal.

            1.1.7.4.17.1.2. Con:
            The resulting God from this argument could fit a number of different worldviews. Thus, the parent begs the question. The teleological argument would be consistent with the God of the Bible; however, one can’t escape this argument by appealing to the God of the Bible.

            1.1.7.4.17.1.3. Con:
            A literal interpretation of the Bible has been disproven on many counts. It cannot be a reliable history.

              1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1. Con:
              As the Bible is a collection of numerous books, there are certain books that can be taken literally depending on the genre. Indeed, many scholars treat these as historical documents whose facts can be explored and verified, thus affirming that many portions of the Bible can be taken literally.

                1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1. Con:
                Large portions of the bible previously taken as history have been demonstrated to be at best incredibly unlikely to have happened. An example is the exodus story which is now thought to never have happened. Here is an introduction to the topic [353]. Over time less and less of the bible has been able to be taken literally, so though some small portions may hold some truth over all the narrative holds little to no credibility.

                  1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1. Pro:
                  The Flood described in Genesis isn't necessary a global flood.

                    1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                    The Flood myth contradicts the geologic record [354].

                    1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                    The laws of physics indicate that moving enough water to cover the planet would take so much energy and generate so much heat that it would also incinerate the Ark of Noah. Thus the Flood could not have been universal, and the story cannot be taken that literally.

                      1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                      A more accurate biblical understanding of the flood is that it was local, not global. English translations typically cause Christians to believe in a literal, worldwide flood. However, it is implausible this is what the biblical author meant.

                        1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                        When you read an English translation of the biblical account of the flood, you will undoubtedly notice many words and verses that seem to suggest that the waters covered all of planet earth. However, one should note that today we look at everything from a global perspective, whereas the Bible nearly always refers to local geography [355]. You may not be able to determine this fact from our English translations, so we must look at the original Hebrew, which is the word of God.

                          1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                          The Hebrew words which are translated as "whole earth" or "all the earth" are kol (Strong's number H3605), which means "all," and erets (Strong's number H776), which means "earth," "land," "country," or "ground." The term kol erets is nearly always used in the Old Testament to describe a local area of land [356], instead of our entire planet.5

                            1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                            Of the 205 instance of kol erets in the Old Testament, it might refer to the entire planet just 40 times,9 and even some of those are questionable. About half of those instance occur in the books of Psalms and Isaiah.

                          1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.2. Pro:
                          The Genesis flood narrative also uses the phrase "the face of the earth." This is the exact phrase used by Cain when he was banished by God (Genesis 4:14). Are we to think that Cain was banished to outer space?

                          1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.3. Pro:
                          In addition, the flood narrative says that "the water increased and lifted up the ark, so that it rose above the earth" (Genesis 7:17). If "earth" really refers to the planet, this text would imply that the ark somehow levitated above the planet. Obviously, "earth" refers to the local land on which the ark was sitting, and not to planet earth.

                          1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.2.1.1.4. Pro:
                          There is a Hebrew word that always refers to the entire earth or the entire inhabited earth. The word is tebel (Strong's H8398), which is found 37 times in the Old Testament. Curiously, this word is never used to describe the flood, although it is used extensively to describe the creation of the earth and the judgment of the peoples of the earth.

                    1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.3. Pro:
                    There are living organisms today that predate the Flood [357]. If the universal flood happened, it would have killed them.

                    1.1.7.4.17.1.3.1.1.1.4. Pro:
                    The flood myth contradicts the archaeological record [358]. Human civilizations existed continuously through the supposed time of the Flood [359], so it cannot have been universal.

                    According to the Chicago Statement [360], the Doctrine of Biblical Inerrancy means the Bible is truthful in everything that it affirms or everything that it teaches. This means there may be things in Scripture that are not part of the assertions or teaching of Scripture and this shouldn't bother us (e.g. non-literal poetry, non-chronological narration, imprecise citation). As interpreters, we shouldn't press the scriptures for precision that isn't warranted.

              1.1.7.4.17.1.4.1. Con:
              Depending on the genre, many of the biblical documents are not meant to be myths. This does not mean that the biblical authors did not make use of hyperbole or metaphorical language consistent with the writings of that time. However, much of the Bible is not meant to be myth.

            1.1.7.4.17.2.1. Pro:
            If archaeologists digging in the earth were to discover things looking like arrowheads and hatchet heads and pottery shards, they would be justified in inferring that these artifacts are not the chance result of sedimentation and metamorphosis, but products of some unknown group of people, even though they had no explanation of who these people were or where they came from.

      1.1.7.5. Pro:
      The universe is ordered. The number of ways a universe could exist as an ordered thing are finite, but the number of ways it could exist as a random thing are infinite. Therefore, our ordered universe's existence is infinitely improbable if there is nothing external to the universe which is responsible for it being ordered. It is, therefore, probable that such a thing exists, and this we call God.

        The number of ways it could exist as a random thing are also finite.

        1.1.7.5.3. Con:
        A random universe of sufficient size would necessarily contain pockets of order. Observers can only exist in ordered regions. This is the anthropic principle. Therefore, we expect to observe an ordered region.

          1.1.7.5.3.1. Con:
          Boltzman brains [364]. A pocket of order is likely no bigger than the observer himself. Therefore we should not expect to observe order in a random universe.

            1.1.7.5.3.1.1. Con:
            An ordered region with complex chemistry and evolution creates observers with far greater frequency than random chance. Therefore we should expect evolved observers to far outnumber Boltzman brains, and we should expect to observe order.

        1.1.7.5.4. Con:
        Bait-and-switch. Calling the explanation "God" is misleading. If the Universe has an explanation, why call it "God"? This has nothing to do with the gods of religion. Call the explanation "X" for now. Does accepting X make one a theist? There is no reason to think so.

          1.1.7.5.4.1. Pro:

          1.1.7.5.4.6. Con:
          The argument results in a transcendent, mind that exists by the necessity of its own nature as the explanation of the universe. This is what most people refer to as God. This conclusion is certainly inconsistent with the proposition, “God doesn’t exist.”

          For order to exist, there must be an orderer.  You can't throw a pile of bricks down and expect them to assemble themselves into a building.  They must be assembled by an intelligence.

            1.1.7.5.8.1.1. Con:
            We know the force of gravity orders solar systems. The oceans order sediment in beaches. There is no need for an organising force to be intelligent.

          1.1.7.5.8.2. Con:
          While it isn't necessarily true that order indicates intelligence or that the appearance of design indicates a designer, in most cases it would be more reasonable to infer intelligence and design as the best explanation (e.g. finding machines on mars or a watch in the middle of nowhere).

            1.1.7.5.8.2.1. Con:
            This is the Texas sharpshooter fallacy. Design is recognised in contrast to what is natural. We know that when nature creates something, it depends on certain cranes of explanation, like variation over generations and selection. By contrast, we know watches are created with intent. Pointing to watches as complex things that are obviously created cherry picks the data points. Door stops are simple but also obviously created. Ocean circulation is complex but natural.

              1.1.7.5.8.2.1.1. Con:
              It is possible that what is “natural,” may be designed. We cannot rule this possibility out simply because things in nature don’t appear “human like” in design.

                1.1.7.5.8.2.1.1.1. Con:
                Many things in nature have a complete, evidenced and coherent explanation for their "appearance of design", both in natural mechanisms by which they assemble and in the human bias towards seeing agency.
                Normally, that would be sufficient to rule out another "possibility".

            1.1.7.5.8.2.2. Con:
            Biological evolution explains the appearance of design in nature, so does not lead to the inference of intelligence.
            We know from Newton trying to progress from two-body motion to multi-body motion that he considered the solar system designed, but it is not (Neil DeGrasse Tyson - Perimeter of Ignorance) [365].
            Ocean currents are complex and creative (i.e. change weather patterns and nutrient flow) and yet are natural, not designed.
            In most cases, inferring intelligence from design is erroneous.

              1.1.7.5.8.2.2.1. Con:
              None of these examples rule out the possibility of a designer. These examples could point to a designer who used certain mechanisms that we consider natural to create ordered results in nature. You can’t rule out a carpenter by pointing to his hammer.

              1.1.7.5.8.2.2.2. Con:
              Even if we discovered every natural cause that gives off the appearance of order or design, this still would not imply that there isn’t a designer behind them.

                1.1.7.5.8.2.2.2.1. Con:
                Having a natural explanation for things removes reason to accept the inference of an intelligence or design.
                The claim about natural explanations isn't evidence a God doesn't exist, it is a response to particular claims as evidence for God.

            1.1.7.5.8.2.3. Con:
            "Appearance of design" is subjective.

            1.1.7.5.8.2.4. Con:
            Inferring intelligence from the "appearance of design" is an argument from ignorance; there is this subjectively profound experience (i.e. the appearance of design) for which one assumes no other explanation exists, therefore it is the result of an intelligence.

              1.1.7.5.8.2.4.1. Con:
              This is not an argument from ignorance. The parent argument never postulates design as the only explanation of order. Other possible alternatives to design would be chance or physical necessity. The parent says that design is the most probable of these choices.

          1.1.7.5.8.3. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.9.1.1.1.

        1.1.7.5.9. Con:
        The number of ways a universe can exist as an ordered thing are equally infinite. There are no reasons why it could not be so.

          1.1.7.5.9.1. Con:
          While it is true that the number of ways a universe can exist as an ordered thing are infinite, it is still incredibly improbable for our universe to exist. For example, it is overwhelmingly more probable that a universe with just our solar system would exist than the universe we do experience. In fact, the simplest observable universe we can imagine is a single existing mind. Therefore, it is still improbable that the actual universe we experience should exist.

            1.1.7.5.9.1.1. Con:
            We cannot verify a range of possible universes, or distribution across the range of all possible universes. We, therefore, have no demonstrable concept of what universe is more or less likely than another.
            To claim otherwise appears to be to assert probability distribution across a range of "conceivable" universes, having confused "conceivable" with "possible".
            Even if it becomes reasonable to assert a God at a level of improbability assigned to the universe, we can't verify such a level.

        1.1.7.5.10. Con:
        If we accept that a random universe is a priori more probable than an ordered universe, then our observations of an ordered universe are more likely to come from random existence as a Boltzmann brain [366] in such a universe than from actually experiencing the universe we believe exists. Hence, there is no fine-tuning to explain.

        1.1.7.5.11. Con:
        Self-organized systems are a common and well known occurrence in physics, due to statistical laws like the central limit theorem. Order in the universe therefore requires no gods.

          1.1.7.5.11.1. Con:
          For the laws of physics to be obeyed they must have already been laws and ordered BEFORE t=0.  This level of order and organization outside of time points to an organizer who lives unbounded by time.

            1.1.7.5.11.1.1. Con:
            There is no such thing as before time = 0 and there cannot be by definition.

        1.1.7.5.12. Con:
        This is an argument from ignorance, just because you don't know what caused the universe to be in this state it doesn't mean a being is the cause or that there is a cause in the first place.

        1.1.7.5.13. Con:
        If there are an infinite number of universes encompassing an infinite number of possibilities then it is inevitable that we will be having this discussion, regardless of the existence or non-existence of God.

        1.1.7.5.14. Con:
        A count of the absolute number of different universes that could exist says nothing about the probability distribution of those different universes. There may be some underlying natural process that favours ordered and complex universes, without intelligence. (As an illustrative example, perhaps the natural process that leads to universes is necessarily coherent, and so the universes are too. I'm not saying this is the case, I am saying that such an alternative is empirically equal to God.)

    1.1.8. Pro:
    There are examples of supernatural miracles. Therefore, God exists.

      1.1.8.1. Pro:
      The apparition [367] of the Virgin above her church in Zeitoon, Egypt is the strongest argument for the existence of a spiritual world which would support the existence of God. The majority of the country is muslim so all attempts have been made to disprove this apparition and all failed.

        The Magic Sandwich is a sandwich well-known by believers to cure cancer. So far no one has been able to provide PROOF and EVIDENCE that anti-sandwichism is ACCURATE and CORRECT, therefore it is reasonable to conclude that the Magic Sandwich cures cancer.

      1.1.8.2. Con:
      For ancient people lightening, earthquakes, or eclipses would have been supernatural events, and therefore evidence for existence of God.

      1.1.8.3. Pro:
      According to the biblical record, the revelation at Sinai occurred before approximately 600,000 men [368]. Falsifying such an event in front of so many people would have been very difficult, so it is more reasonable to believe that it occurred.

        1.1.8.3.1. Con:
        There is no evidence that a revelation occurred or that 600,000 people witnessed it.

      1.1.8.4. Pro:
      Jesus proved His claims to deity by rising from the dead.

        1.1.8.4.1. Con:
        So did Osiris.

          1.1.8.4.1.1. Con:
          The parent is a red herring and therefore fallacious. Rather than interact with the evidence for Jesus life, death, and resurrection, it seeks to undermine it by pointing to others supposed figures who claimed to rise or were believed to rise from the dead. One must evaluate each of these claims in turn. Pointing them out in a conversation about Jesus is a tactic only meant to distract and is therefore a red herring.

            1.1.8.4.1.1.1. Con:
            The existence of other gods undermines monotheism, but any standard of evidence lax enough to permit Yahweh or a divine Jesus also permits many other gods.

              1.1.8.4.1.1.1.1. Pro:
              There's far more evidence for the divinity of Sathya Sai Baba [369] than for Jesus of Nazareth. He's even got YouTube videos. Prepare to be unimpressed. Then hold Jesus to the same standard of evidence.

                1.1.8.4.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                Sathya Sai Baba raised the dead. Allegedly.

            1.1.8.4.1.1.2. Con:
            Bayesian analysis requires one to consider prior probabilities [370] and likelihood ratios (i.e. true positives to false positives on the evidence). Therefore cases of claimed resurrection that turned out to be false is relevant information, and not red herrings.

        1.1.8.4.8. Con:
        the Resurrection Theory is a dismal failure as an explanation [374] of the empty tomb and postmortem appearances of Jesus—being ad hoc and almost completely devoid of explanatory power and scope

        1.1.8.4.9. Con:
        Since it has not been proven that he rose from the dead it has not been proven that he was a deity. There is no consensus [375] in modern scholarship that he rose from the dead or that the tomb was even empty.

        1.1.8.4.10. Con:
        It is a lot more probable that a dead body was stolen, guards bribed, etc.   than a dead body came to life.
        
        Even if the story of the empty tomb is true (and there is no agreement on that among historians) there are more probable explanations than a dead body coming to life.

          1.1.8.4.10.1. Con:
          It is a well established historical fact [376] that Jesus’ disciples were transformed from doubters to bold proclaimers of His death and resurrection. Jesus’ body being stolen cannot sufficiently explain their courage. If the disciples stole the body, they would not die for something they knew was false. If someone else stole the body, they wouldn’t have confidence that Jesus actually rose.

            1.1.8.4.10.1.1. Con:

If the body was stolen, the disciples would not have had these experiences unless they were tricked. However, it is highly improbable that such an elaborate scheme to fool the disciples into believing they saw the resurrected Jesus would have been successful. They were with Jesus for three years!

          It has been established as a physical possibility, via quantum tunneling. There is a nonzero probability of the particles of a corpse spontaneously rearranging themselves into a living organism.

            1.1.8.4.11.1.1. Con:
            While nonzero, the prior probability of this happening is astronomically small. Even an elaborate hoax is far more probable than that.

            It's not like we aren't trying hard to resuscitate  people’s hearts that have stopped beating. It fails, it's hard to achieve, it's often short-lived, and it's a clear indicator of soon-to-be irremediable degradation. We may have an absence of evidences of resurrections, but we already know too well that its lesser counterpart (reanimation) is hard to achieve. In that mindset, considering probabilities is more fair than dismissing a claim on the ground of a lack of proof of the opposite.

          1.1.8.4.11.5. Con:
          This is a categorical mistake: the resurrection of the body, in a Christian sense, is something very different. It doesn't take place within the realm of 'biological possibility'. Cf. for example Paul in 1 Corinthians 15.35-44. The body we now have (and the body Jesus had before His resurrection) and the body we will have at the resurrection (i.e. the resurrection body) are comparable to a seed and the plant that grows out of it; they have an elemental connection, yet they are very different.

          It far outstrips any of its rival hypotheses as a justified historical description. Down through history various alternative explanations of the facts have been offered, for example, the conspiracy hypothesis, the apparent death hypothesis, the hallucination hypothesis, and so forth. Such hypotheses have been almost universally rejected by contemporary scholarship. None of these naturalistic hypotheses succeeds in meeting the conditions as well as the resurrection hypothesis.

      1.1.9.1. Pro:
      Leibnizian Cosmological Argument [383] (by Dr. William Ln. Craig)
      1. Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence, either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause.
      2. If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God. 
      3. The universe exists. 
      4. Therefore, the universe has an explanation of its existence. 
      5. Therefore, the explanation of the existence of the universe is God.

        1.1.9.1.1. Con:
        P2) and P5) redefine the word 'God' into a meaningless utterance that can't be used to make any premise or draw any further conclusions.

          1.1.9.1.1.1. Con:
          A scientific explanation (which is assumed to be some sort of observed interactions between matter and energy or a model of such interactions) would be an explanation of something inside of the universe. Thus, the universe still needs an explanation of its existence in an external cause or by the necessity of its nature.

            1.1.9.1.1.1.1. Con:
            This is an irrelevant counter argument to the claim that P2) and P5) of the grandparent utilizes the word 'God' as a meaningless utterance.

            1.1.9.1.1.1.2. Con:
            The Universe may be a "Brute Fact" and thus have no explanation for its existence, undermining P1.

              1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
              Claiming the universe’s existence is a brute fact is the same as saying the universe exists without an explanation. This makes the universe an exception to the principles that everything that exists has an explanation of its existence. This is arbitrary.

                1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                Adding a God with no explanation for His existence as the explanation for the universe only pushes the problem back a step without solving it. It is a simpler hypothesis to stop one step earlier. Thus we can cut off God with Occam's razor.

                  1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                  God exists by the necessity of His own nature. Under premise 1 of the Leibniz Cosmological Argument to exist by necessity of ones own nature is still an explanation.

                    1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    "The necessity of its own nature" is not a valid explanation for anything. No-one would take seriously the suggestion that the ball existed there by the necessity of its own nature.

                      While philosophers aren’t in perfect agreement about what metaphysical necessity is (for philosophers don’t really agree on anything), they have had no trouble having discussions regarding metaphysical necessity [384] and many have had no trouble accepting it as a valid explanation of being.

                        Abstract objects depend on God [386] for their existence, and abstract objects exist in every world; therefore, God exists in every world.

                          2 Let y be "God" and x be an abstract object (the number four, say).
                          3 the "if and only if" relation is symmetric implication (also written <=>), thus, if the number four were not to exist, neither would God. i.e. God depends on the number four (and each other abstract object) for His existence.
                          4 thus God is not the source of being for any abstract object.

                          1. It is possible that a maximally great being exists.
                          2. If (1) then a maximally great being exists in some possible world.
                          3. If (2) then it exists in every possible world.

                          5. If (4) then a maximally great being exists.
                          6. Therefore a maximally great being exists.
                          
                          Maximal greatness is the property of having maximal excellence (omniscience, omnipotence, omnibenevolence) in every possible world.

                            1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.1. Con:
                            This ontological argument does not establish the certainty of God's existence. It merely shows that it is reasonable to assume God exists if one accepts each and every premise.

                              1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.1.1. Con:
                              The ontological argument demonstrates that if a maximally great being is even possible, then a maximally great being must exist. This is very different from establishing epistemological warrant.

                                This rests on an "if" condition (if a maximally great being is possible). Until that "if" condition can be verified as true, the ontological argument does not support the original thesis of "God exists".

                                  The parent is equivalent to saying, “if the premises of the argument are true, then the argument supports the thesis “God exists.” This is obviously true.

                            1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.2. Con:
                            The concept of a universe where "a maximally great being" cannot possibly exist is an intuitively coherent notion. Therefore, we can make an equivalent ontological argument which would invalidate P2.

                              An equivalent argument of this nature would be: 
                              
                              P1. It is possible that a maximally great being does not exist. 
                              P2. If it is possible that a maximally great being does not exist, then a maximally great being cannot possibly exist in some possible world. 
                              
                              P2 does not follow from P1. Therefore, an equivalent argument cannot be made that would result in a maximally great being not existing by necessity.

                              1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.2.2. Pro:
                              A half-open interval has no greatest point, because it does not include its limit. Thus even if we grant a well-ordering of "greatness", it does not follow that there is a greatest element is even possible, much less that it actually exists.

                            1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.3. Con:
                            An equivalent ontological argument which negates this one could be:
                            1. An entity with maximal greatness is not possible
                            2. Hence, there is no possible world in which there is an entity which possesses maximal greatness.
                            3. Hence, no entity with maximal greatness exists in the actual world.
                            4. Hence, an entity with maximal greatness does not exist.

                              P1. There is no reason to think that an entity with maximal greatness is not possible. The collective case for God's existence, composed of both a priori and a posteriori evidence, gives us warrant to think a maximally great being is at least possible. Moreover, the evidence presented against God's existence is not conclusive enough to override the evidence for God's existence. Therefore, there isn't sufficient warrant to accept that a maximally great being isn't possible.

                              The parent assumes that God must personally experience every state of affairs to “know” it. This is an unwarranted assumption. There is no reason why God couldn’t know the experiential thoughts and feelings resulting from human (or other types of beings) experiences of not knowing something. Moreover, we’d have to believe that God would have to become everything to know everything (e.g he’d have to become a bat to know what it is like to be a bat, or a mouse to understand mouseness).

                                Perhaps God could have some kind of propositional knowledge regarding failing to know, but not experiential knowledge. This only assumes that direct experience is a different form of knowledge from that which is not direct experience. It means, for instance, that God could know that my lack of knowledge causes me distress, but God cannot know it in the form in which I know it, namely by direct experience. God would not experience ignorance-triggered-distress.

                                  Overpopulation of palm trees, hotels or hammocks would make the island less awesome. Therefore, the maximally awesome island has the optimal population of such things.

                            Kant refuted ontological arguments in Of the Impossibility of an Ontological Proof [388]: "To suppose the existence of a triangle and not that of its three angles, is self-contradictory; but to suppose the non-existence of both triangle and angles is perfectly admissible.

"It is possible that a maximally great being exists" could be read as "It might be the case that such a being could, possibly, exist", or "It's definitely possible that such a being could exist, whether or not they do in any particular universe."  We don't know whether a maximally good being could exist in any universe that could exist, so we can't accept P1--even though it sounds like we can, due to the conflation.

                              There is no such conflation. P1 is clearly stating simply that it is possible that maximally great being exists. Within the context of the argument, it doesn't make any sense to distinguish between levels of possibility. P1 is either true or false. A maximally great being is either possible or impossible.

                                To believe that, "a maximally great being is impossible in any possible world" is a statement that would require great evidence. One would have to conclusively demonstrate that a maximally great being isn't even POSSIBLE. There are arguments against the existence of a maximally great being; however, it is far from apparent these are so conclusive as to render the existence of a maximally great being impossible. The burden of proof is thus too high to arrive at this conclusion.

                                Whereas believing that a maximally great being is impossible would take great evidence, believing that we don't know whether or not such is possible, takes little to none.  It is simply the default position to admit that we don't know--and as such, can't claim that we know that it *is* possible.

                                  This misgiving results from thinking of the project of natural theology in too linearly. The ontological argument plays a part in a cumulative case for theism, in which a multitude of factors simultaneously conspire to lead one to the global conclusion that God exists. The argument encapsulates the thrust of all the arguments together to show the Supreme Being, exists. In other words, the validity of other arguments for God grant warrant for thinking a maximally great being is possible.

                              P1 assumes that "the greatness of beings" is a well-ordered set that includes its boundary point. This is an unwarranted assumption. It may be possible that to be the greatest in one great-making property entails sub-maximal greatness in other properties.

                            1 If Goldbach’s conjecture is correct, then it is necessarily true.
                            2 It is possible that Goldbach’s conjecture is correct.
                            3 Therefore, possibly, it is necessarily true that Goldbach’s Conjecture is correct.
                            4 Therefore (by modal logic axiom S5) it is necessarily true that Goldbach’s Conjecture is correct.
                            5 Therefore Goldbach’s Conjecture is correct.
                            This form can prove any conjecture without proving it [391], which is patently absurd.

                              This is false comparison. The ontological argument proves the existence of a metaphysical being, not how we know a proposition is true (such as a conjecture). This seems to confuse metaphysical statements with epistemological statements.

                                Mathematical truths are metaphysically necessary. They hold for any possible world. (Metaphysical necessity is how we distinguish possible worlds from impossible worlds.)

                            2. That being is, from our perspective, functionally ominiscient, omnipotent, omnibelenvolent, etc
                            3. Therefore, a pantheon of Gods exists. 
                            
                            Polytheism is the only logical conclusion.

                                (1 of 2) You can’t define something into a non-abstract existence. The first premise suggests that it’s “possible” that a “maximally great being” exists. Which has been pre-defined as existing in “every possible world”. Since this remains only a possibility, it is also justified to say that it is possible that no such being exists in any possible world. Therefore, the argument fails.

                                (2 of 2) Premise (2) doesn't follow logically from premise (1) because it asserts that things which are possible to exist must exist in some "possible world". This concept is incoherent. If possible worlds are actual worlds, then this is where the unjustified transition occurs. If possible worlds are still hypotheticals, then premise (2) is logically equivalent to premise (1) and is unnecessary.

                            In math there's a notion of empty set — a collection of zero items. The elements of empty set have an amusing property of matching any possible description: e. g., each and every element of empty set is both even and odd at the same time; each element of empty set is both large and small etc, etc. You can waste quite a lot of time examining all the properties of the elements of an empty set. Remember they don't exist though. Qualities ascribed to god are of similar nature.

There are many who do not think good is an objective or useful term. Moral philosophers have long argued about what good actually is to no avail. Therefore a maximally great being by the parents definition is not possible without an objective notion of good.

                            P2 is an incoherent statement nothing can exist in a possible world unless that possible world actually exists. It has to be phrased as a maximally great being could exist in some possible world. Such a statement no longer has any force.

                              If the parent is true, then the practice of using possible worlds in modal logic to distinguish between necessary and possible truths is null a void. Many high caliber philosophers would highly disagree with this notion as they conduct this practice all the time.

                            All this establishes is that a god-belief is not inherently contradictory. But it does not (in itself) give us any justification for believing. Plantiga himself admits this:
                            
                            "Our verdict on these reformulated versions of St. Anselm's argument must be as follows. They cannot, perhaps, be said to prove or establish their conclusion. But since it is rational to accept their central premise, they do show that it is rational to accept that conclusion"

                              When Plantinga says “rational” he means that one is justified and warranted to hold that belief. When he uses the words “establish or prove,” he likely means show evidence for. These are key distinctions for Plantinga.

Additionally, the described characteristics of a "maximally great being" are mostly impossible in the context of observed reality. See follow up refutations of each trait...

It will not be true to say it is possible that God exists or it is possible that he doesn’t. That would be to say that God exists in some possible worlds but he doesn’t exist in other possible worlds. That would be metaphysically incorrect. The concept of a maximally great being is such that it either exists in all possible worlds or it exists in none of them.

                                We have examples of this in other areas. Goldbach’s Conjecture says that every even number greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Although it has been tested to enormous lengths, no mathematician has ever been able to prove it or disprove it. In this epistemic sense one can say it could be true or false. But as a piece of mathematics, it is either necessary or impossible. It cannot possibly be true and possibly be false in this metaphysical sense.

                                God can exist and not be a being or be maximally great. This is purely metaphysical nonsense, since no maximally great being seems to exist. Therefore, the "two universes" hypothesis isn't redressed by logic about maximally great beings.

You cannot say that everything has an explanation of its existence and then suddenly exempt the universe from this demand. That  would be simply arbitrary.

                                The precedent is the laws of relativity, where nothing can move through spacetime faster than the speed of light, but spacetime itself can move faster than the speed of light (hence hyperinflation).

                              It is impossible for the universe to have an explanation of its existence because the explanation of the universe would have to be some prior state of affairs in which the universe didn’t yet exist. This would be nothingness and nothingness can’t be the explanation of anything. So the universe must just exist inexplicably.

                                    The philosophical "nothing" may be impossible as the existence of 'something' makes philosophical nothing a contradiction. The idea that philosophical nothing could give rise to something (even with interference from God) may be logically contradictory. This is because the philosophical nothing would need some sort of 'potential' to give rise to something. Having potential contradicts the philosophical nothing.

                                    Natural Laws are facts which we represent as equations. But, in the same way as 'the map is not the place', Natural Laws are not the equations.

                This premise begs the question, by assuming that transcendent beings can be explanations for material things.

                  1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  The parent is a fallacy fallacy. P2 of this argument cannot possibly beg the question because P1, P3 and P4 establish that whatever caused the universe must be external to the universe.

                1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.3. Con:
                Here's the twist. "If God is not the explanation for the Universe, then the Universe has no explanation", only sounds acceptable if interpreted as "If God is not the explanation for the Universe, then the Universe has no known explanation." But the explanation could be unknown, and not be God.

                    1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1. Con:
                    The Christian God is defined using abstract and vague terms, such as 'omnipotent [406]', that he 'knoweth all things [407]', 'full of compassion [408]' and 'plenteous in mercy in truth [409]'. Since we do not know what 'all things' includes, nor what knowledge 'omnipotent' suggests, we cannot say that the Christian God, at least, is well-defined.

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.1. Con:
                      According to Wayne Grudem, God’s knowledge (omniscience) may be defined as follows: God fully knows himself and all things actual and possible in one simple and eternal act. There is nothing vague or incoherent about this definition.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.1. Con:
                        'God knows himself' is a highly subjective claim as it presupposes an understanding and knowledge of God which is not possible.

                          1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          The parent is irrelevant to the coherence of God being omniscient. One does not need perfect knowledge of God to recognize omniscience is a coherent concept. There is nothing contradictory about this idea.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.2. Con:
                        'All things actual and possible' is incoherent because it presupposes a knowledge of all things, which no-one can claim to possess.

                          1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.1.2.1. Con:
                          One does not need to know “all things” to understand the concept of “all things actual and possible.”

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.2. Con:
                      While there is some disagreement among Christian theologians over the exact definitions of God’s various attributes (e.g some might think God doesn’t have knowledge of the future), this poses no problem in forming a coherent definition of God. Every one of these theologians have no problem conducting meaningful , intellectual discourse regarding God. They all know to whom they refer. The very fact they have such extensive discourse is evidence that what is meant by “God” is well defined.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.2.1. Con:
                        This is an invalid argument. The premise that theologians are able to have discussions about God (intellectual or otherwise) is not a sufficient condition to show the truth of the conclusion that God is well-defined. It is highly probable that each of them have subtly different definitions of God and have simply never stopped to agree on a concrete definition.

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.3. Con:
                      In a number guessing contest, we don’t know by mere sight the exact number of candy pieces in a gallon sized jar. Yet, we still know there is a finite set of candies within the jar. Similarly, we don’t know all knowledge, but we can still recognize that there is a finite set of knowledge to attain and recognize that God has that knowledge. Therefore, we do not need all knowledge to know what we mean by saying God has all knowledge (the attribute of omniscience).

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.3.1. Con:
                        This is a weak analogy. In the case of the candy jar we are observing from the outside in and can clearly see the boundaries. In reality, we are like a particle of dust in the centre of the candy jar and have absolutely no evidence that there is any limit. There is no evidence to suggest that a finite set of knowledge exists.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.3.2. Con:
                        There is no theoretical limit to the number of possible theorems in mathematics. Thus the claim that the set of all possible things knowable is finite, is dubious.

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.4. Con:
                      According to Wayne Grudem, God’s goodness means that God is the final standard of good, and that all that God is and does is worthy of approval. There is nothing incoherent or ill defined about this attribute.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.4.1. Con:
                        There is no evidence to suggest that God is responsible for anything that has ever happened. Therefore, what God has done is unclear.

                        1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.1.4.2. Con:
                        Since no-one can actually explain under scrutiny what God is or how He would exist, to say that He is the 'final standard of good' does not help one to understand his omnibenevolence.

                    Some elements of the God presented in the Bible aren't coherent and therefore are not part of something that is "well defined" e.g. the Trinity.
                    Others are contradictory, like a God who couldn't stop Iron chariots. That also, then, is not "well defined".

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.2.1. Con:
                      The Trinity is not an incoherent concept [410]. There are coherent models [411] of the Trinity.

                      1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.6.2.2.2. Con:
                      "God couldn't stop iron chariots," is a very poor exegesis of Judges 1:19. It is far more likely, given the context, that God forsook Judah in the taking of plains, because they were afraid of them, or they committed slothfulness, or were weary of fighting, or fell into some sins. There is no reason to interpret this as "God couldn't stop iron chariots."

                Those two claims are not logically equivalent. A real equivalent statement to P2 is: 'God is defined as the explanation of the universe'.

                1.1.9.1.4.1.1.1.9. Con:
                An Explanation isn't a concept. Rather, scientific evidence is required for anything to be an Explanation. "God" is an excuse, a way of waving hands and saying it happened. Rather, we should stick to scientific principles, as hard as they are to understand.

Why does the world exist? Why is the world-stuff what it is? Why does it have mental or subjective aspects as well as material or objective ones? We do not know.” Julian Huxley

                  Since scientific evidence is required for any proposition to be valid, then the very methods of science aren’t valid because they can’t be verified using scientific methods. Science presupposes rationality, logic, math, and trust in our physical senses. Thus, the parent is self-defeating.

        This claim is a close cousin to the idea that god is unknowable to man, and yet man "knows" about god. It is impossible for something unknowable to be known, understood, or comprehensible in any way, yet entire ideologies are formed around these unknowns.

        There are at least 2 ways if interpreting premise 2.
        (1) That some powerful agent existing outside of the universe, which is alluded to in a number of religious texts, is the explanation.
        (2) Whatever the explanation is, we are labelling it God i.e. The definition of God is 'the explanation of the existence of the universe'. Both have problems.

          1.1.9.1.14.2. Pro:
          Under interpretation 1 (see parent claim), it does not follow that the universe requires an agent that is powerful to create the universe. The explanation could be a natural and cumulative process -- which is neither powerful nor an agency.

            1.1.9.1.14.2.1. Con:
            A natural and cumulative process as an explanation would immeadiately lead to the question, “what is the explanation of that cumulative process?” It is very unlikely that any such process would have to exist by the necessity of its own nature. Thus, it would need to be explained by an external cause.

        The concept named as 'God' clearly exists, but only therefore in what may be termed a conceptual context. As the discussion concerns an object of discussion, then clearly that object exists in discussion, but then so can anything that can be discussed. What is, is i.e. everything - that which is called 'Universe'. However, to say there is a Universe that knows it exists and is called such, is human construct, which indeed of course is what 'God' is - a concept,

        1.1.9.1.17. Con:
        Premise 2 accepts the conclusion of the argument that it is supposed to support. By saying, the universe is explained by God, the requirement for this premise to be considered sound would be to demonstrate a God exists, which is what this  the argument is about in the first place. This is tantamount to circular reasoning.

          1.1.9.1.17.1. Con:
          P2 is not circular reasoning. One could make P2 read: if the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is an unembodied, transcendent mind. But this is what most people mean by God so the argument just uses God for brevity. One might not be convinced by the argument for a transcendent mind, but that is different from circular reasoning. There is no informal fallacy here.

          1.1.9.1.17.2. Con:
          This is not circular simply because of how the logical if->then statement works. (If P then Q) is true if both P and Q are true or if P is false. (If P then Q) is equivalent to (not P or Q). Therefore P2 can be true even if god does not exist and even if the universe has no explanation. Therefore it does not assume the things the parent accuses it of. However this does not necessarily mean that the premise is true just that it is not circular.

        1.1.9.1.18. Con:
        Premise 1 may overreach: it may be that all things that exist within the universe have an explanation.
        The individuals that make up the set may behave differently to the set. To assume that it must be other than this is a fallacy of composition.

        P1 is an unproven claim. In fact, several scientific discoveries indicate the opposite (quantum dynamics has shown unexplained randomness; positions, speeds, time and energy exist only with certain probabilities, and just never notice the effect due to it being negligible on the macro-scale).

        1.1.9.1.21. Con:
        The claim is based upon a notion of causality which is demonstrably incorrect.  Never, ever, has there been a single cause leading to a single effect.  Instead, it is always a fact that there are multiple causes leading to multiple results.  The Classical notion of causality is pure bull.

        1.1.9.1.22. Pro:
        When we look things around us, we can always ask ourselves, “where did this all came from or who created these things? Then we arrived at thinking about the first cause, the Person who let the universe stay still and move the earth and moon in their right places. There is always a reason for everything and it is always because of God.

          1.1.9.1.23.1. Con:
          This just begs the question; if God (as defined) actually IS the explanation for the Universe, then God is trivially NOT just a placeholder (any more than any other explanation).

            1.1.9.1.23.1.1. Con:
            God is just a placeholder because there is no objective reason to place God over any other conceivable explanation.

          1.1.9.1.23.2. Con:
          Counter examples exist: e.g. if you find yourself in a state resembling heaven/hell, after an ostensible divine judgment by God, then God is obviously not a placeholder. Therefore, God is not trivially a placeholder for ignorance. (See: beliefmap.org)

            1.1.9.1.23.2.1. Con:
            No counter examples exist, and the  example provided is a subjective interpretation.

          1.1.9.1.23.3. Con:
          All explanations, without exception, are "just placeholders" if we take Gödel's incompleteness theorems [414] seriously. The question is then not whether God is a placeholder, but whether there are better placeholders, with more explanatory capacity, than God available.

            1.1.9.1.23.3.1. Con:
            "God did it" has no explanatory capacity unless it makes a testable prediction.

            1.1.9.1.23.3.2. Con:
            There are formal systems that can prove their own consistency [415]. They just can't do diagonalization. Therefore, incompleteness doesn't apply to everything.

          1.1.9.1.23.6. Con:
          This is a non-sequitur. It states that God is used to explain too many things we don’t understand. Therefore, God cannot be an explanation for the universe?!? The conclusion doesn’t follow. Even if we grant that God is used as a placeholder to explain some things unjustifiably, it isn’t necessarily true that this holds in all cases.

            1.1.9.1.23.6.1. Con:
            Nothing has ever been explained by the existence of God, and the number of things for which God is claimed to provide an explanation for has declined in line with scientific progress.
            
            These Gods of the gaps are just placeholders for things we don't understand.

              In history there were gods for the wind and seas until we understood the forces manipulating the wind and seas.
              
              God was easily used as a place holder for things we didn't understand and that same amount of inaccuracy is being used today.

            1.1.9.1.23.7.1. Con:
            The claim isn't "the thing that explains the universe is the thing that explains the universe." So this misrepresents the theists claim. (God is full of additional content, like being all-good, and all-knowing.)

        1.1.9.1.24. Con:
        Dr. William Lane Craig's first presupposition that everything has an explanation of its existence is false, and the counter-example is randomness. Stochasticity exists and has been measured in nature (even in life). So the universe itself could plausibly have resulted from statistical randomness.

          1.1.9.1.24.1. Con:
          Apparent randomness is merely ignorance. The universe is deterministic. "Random" things have unknown explanations, which is different than lacking explanation.

            1.1.9.1.24.1.1. Con:
            Experiments in quantum mechanics provide evidence that our universe is not deterministic.  Deterministic theories of quantum mechanics were attempted (so-called "hidden variable" theories), but in 1964 John Bell demonstrated that if one of these theories were true, then the Bell inequality must be satisfied.  Experimentally results are not constrained by this inequality which rules out a deterministic universe.

              1.1.9.1.24.1.1.1. Con:
              The Many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is fully deterministic and has no "hidden variables". Thus a deterministic universe is wholly compatible with Bell's theorem.

                1.1.9.1.24.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The many worlds interpretation still depends on the unitary evolution of the wave equation, so in that sense could be considered deterministic, however for observers who exist in a solitary universe they still experience reality probabilistically as the other potentials are unfolding in other universes.

              1.1.9.1.24.1.1.2. Con:
              The de Broglie–Bohm theory is deterministic. It has "hidden variables" but does not violate Bell's theorem because it is also nonlocal. Thus Bell's theorem does not rule out a deterministic universe.

        1.1.9.1.25. Con:
        One can accept ex nihilo nihil fit and that brute facts such as existence by definition don't have explanations, without any necessity of some persona named "God".

          1.1.9.1.25.1. Con:
          One can accept or assert any proposition they want in an epistemological sense about any topic. This does nothing to change the metaphysical reality of God’s existence or non-existence.

            1.1.9.1.25.1.1. Con:
            No, one cannot. Assertions must have warrant. When there is a proposition, we assume there are at least two (though there are many more) possibilities with it; namely, that it is true or that it is false. Metaphysical propositions are not truth-bearing however. As such a proposition, God is a set of axiomatic tautological notions that effect how we view the world. There's no other reality to any of this but that.

              1.1.9.1.25.1.1.1. Con:
              If the proposition, "God is a set of axiomatic tautological notions" is regarded as true than the proposition itself is also an axiomatic tautological notion. It falls to the same fate.

                1.1.9.1.25.1.1.1.1. Con:
                Tu quoque. Such a statement is about transcendence, not about God.

            1.1.9.1.25.1.2. Con:
            True but irrelevant.  The purpose of argument is not to cause God's existence or non-existence, but determine it.

          1.1.9.1.25.3. Con:
          To suggest “what one cannot do is suggest God explains anything at all,” or that God is only a set of axiomatic tautological notions is to assume that God does not exist as a metaphysical reality. This begs the question.

            1.1.9.1.25.3.1. Con:
            no, it doesn't actually, since i have to ask what question is begged. what i would guess is that you think my comment is about god. no, my comment is about what the word "transcendent" means and what it implies. as transcendent, god cannot be known. transcendence entails incomprehensiblity. the logical result is dialectically that claims about god are incoherent; essentially all are of the form "i comprehend the incomprehensible".

            1.1.9.1.25.3.2. Con:
            this particular comment is about our use of the word "god" ... which again, dialectically entails to tautology. that is: 1) what causes x, 2) god, 3) what is god, 4) that which causes x. if god is claimed to be an explanation for any x, then what is explained? the simplified tautology is merely 1) what causes x, 2) that which causes x, which of course begs 3) WHAT causes x.

            1.1.9.1.25.3.3. Con:
            it doesn't at all assume there is no god. it simply recognizes the implications of claims that god is transcendent and god is ineffable. there may be a god. in fact, for the sake of argument, let's both say there is. this problem of god-talk not being about god remains.

        1.1.9.1.26. Con:
        One cannot suggest that God explains anything at all or that God is necessary for or to anything. One can accept "God caused the universe to come into being" and "What is God?" as tautology (ie. God is that which causes universes) without admitting to this being an explanation, because it isn't.

          1.1.9.1.26.1. Con:
          God can be an explanation for some things and we can discover TRUTH (what God is actually like in REALITY).

            1.1.9.1.26.1.1. Pro:
            Attributes of God can be derived from deductive argument. For example, the Kalaam Cosmological Argument concludes that the universe had a cause. It then goes on to infer the cause must have been a“beginningless, uncaused, timeless, spaceless, changeless, immaterial, enormously powerful Personal Creator of the universe.” [417]

              1.1.9.1.26.1.1.1. Con:
              Logical conclusions aren't about reality and do not entail truth.

                1.1.9.1.26.1.1.1.1. Con:
                One must use logic and reason to arrive at, “logical conclusions aren’t about reality and do not entail truth.” Therefore, the parent is self defeating.

                  1.1.9.1.26.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Reasonableness is a brute fact.

                    1.1.9.1.26.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                    To conclude that a brute fact exists one would have to reason that since there are only x number of possible explanations for y, and none of those explanations actually explain y, y must be inexplicable. This is using reason to prove reasonableness is a brutre fact. Thus the parent is self-defeating.

              1.1.9.1.26.1.1.2. Con:
              Ex nihilo nihil fit only implies that something has always existed. This doesn't logically entail to a personal creator; energy/matter completely satisfy ex nihilo nihil fit.

              1.1.9.1.26.1.4.1. Con:
              it is true that some arguments for God’s existence logically arrive at attributes that are typically ascribed to God. Far from weakening the God hypothesis, this strengthens it.

              1.1.9.1.26.1.4.2. Con:
              Not all arguments for God’s existence discover attributes of God. Some hypothesize God as the best explanation of some observed phenomena (e.g. fine tuning or objective moral values and duties). If the parent is true, it means that God is these observed phenomena. This is absurd. In the case of the teleological argument, we’d have to believe that God was a unique set of constants and quantities that result in a life-permitting universe. As these don’t stand in causal relations, this is absurd.

            Question: Why is there morality? Answer: God is the source/cause of morality. Question: What is God? Answer: God is that which is the source/cause of morality. Question: So morality is explained by saying "that which is the source/cause of morality is why there's morality?" (rhetorical of course)

              1.1.9.1.26.1.5.1. Con:
              The moral argument does not seek to answer, “what is God.”  It simply suggests that God (whatever that is attributionaly) as the best explanation for the existence of objective moral values and duties. Therefore, the parent is a strawman.

        1.1.9.1.27. Con:
        From our understandings of causality, it makes sense to properly infer that the universe has a causal explanation due to the available evidence; however that doesn't render the claim, “God created the universe” sufficient to explain that cause.  Simply because an idea can technically account for something, doesn't mean it is reasonable to believe or is the actual cause.

          1.1.9.1.27.1. Con:
          God is the best hypothesis for explaining why the universe exists rather than doesn’t. When compared to competing hypotheses, God is more convincing.

            1.1.9.1.27.1.1. Con:
            "Convincing" is subjective, and not objective. Simply because something is convincing, doesn't mean it is true.

          1.1.9.1.27.2. Con:
          To ponder the existence of God, one cannot apply "our understanding of causality"--it immediately boxes His existence inside a finite understanding.  An infinite being cannot be understood or comprehended finitely, only accepted.

      God exists because no other thing could have created the universe. God (an infinite non physical being with values) is the only thing possible to create the universe; because the alternative is an infinite physical counterpart without values(such as the multiverse), and that is not possible to exist on its own without a cause, because it have to obey to the law of causality due to its physical nature.

        1.1.9.2.1. Con:
        The parent assumes a complete understanding of physics where none exists. It is an argument from ignorance that says, “I don't know what made the universe so it must be god.”

        1.1.9.2.2. Con:
        The laws of causality do not apply to the creation of the universe. Causality requires entropic time. For us to say B happened BECAUSE of A, requires that A happened BEFORE B. Since time starts at the big bang, its not logical to suggest that the big bang had a casual relationship with some other event or entity.

          Even if cosmologists were to discover a principle that makes the generation of universes an inherent and certain activity, that principle could be asserted to "have begun to exist" and therefore not affect the Kalam Cosmological Argument.

        The universe is defined as "all space-time reality", which excludes non-space-time realities which might exist in the multiverse. The universe could thus be cause by the interaction of these other universes. But there is no reason to assume these other universes must be uncaused, nonphysical, or Being(s).

          1.1.9.3.3.1. Con:
          Even if our universe is caused by the interaction of other universes, this simply kicks the problem up a level. Arvind Borde and Alexander Vilenkin showed that any space-time eternally inflating toward the future cannot be “geodesically complete” in the past, that is to say, there must have existed at some point in the indefinite past an initial singularity.

            1.1.9.3.3.1.1. Pro:
            “A model in which the inflationary phase has no end . . . naturally leads to this question: Can this model also be extended to the infinite past? . . . This is in fact not possible in future-eternal inflationary spacetimes as long as they obey some reasonable physical conditions:such models must necessarily possess initial singularities. . . . The fact that inflationary spacetimes are past incomplete forces one to address the question of what, if anything, came before.”

        For something to be the cause of an event, it must occur before that event. Since time begins at the moment of the big bang, nothing can occur before the creation of the universe. Hence, from a common understanding of causality, the universe CANNOT have a cause.

          1.1.9.3.4.1. Con:
          The BEFORE argument takes time for granted. Time can in fact fall under the same causal argument. If time had a beginning, time must have had a cause. Of course, since by definition nothing was before the beginning of time, the cause only needed to exist at the genesis of time.

            If something can come into being from nothing, then it becomes inexplicable why just anything or everything doesn’t come into being from nothing.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.3.1. Pro:
              From a limited knowledge or perspective the Universe seems to do this until one can investigate the cause.  Mice and insects were once thought to spontaneously generate from filth.  Mold and algae were thought to spontaneously generate from dampness.  Their causes were unknown.

            1.1.9.3.5.2.4. Pro:
            Common experience and scientific evidence confirm the truth of premise 1. It is more plausibly true than false in light of the evidence.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.4.1. Con:
              -> See 1.1.9.1.6.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2. Con:
              Science demonstrates that things come from other things. It does not demonstrate that this is exclusive behaviour.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.1. Pro:
                We have no sample of 'nothing' to investigate its nature and causative power, or to confirm the grandparent claim that 'something cannot come from nothing'.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.2. Con:
                We can concede this as true and still be rational in accepting premise 1 as more plausibly true than false.

                  1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.2.1. Con:
                  "More plausibly true than false" could mean 50.5% confidence in a claim. That is insufficient confidence to actually accept the claim. (Social sciences work to 90% confidence, most hard sciences work to 95%, medicine works to 99.9% and modern physics works to 99.99...%.)

                  1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.2.2. Con:
                  Plausibility of the claim "something cannot come from nothing" cannot be established. There are no verified examples of "nothing" for an investigation into its causative properties to be established.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.3. Con:
                We can’t be 100% certain that the sun will rise tomorrow. However, it is still rational to believe it will. In the same way, it is rational to believe that something cannot come from nothing, based on the inductive evidence from science and our experience.

                  1.1.9.3.5.2.4.2.3.1. Con:
                  Induction works by assuming things of similar categories will have regularities: in time, like sunrises; in gravity, like denser items falling through malleable materials; in chemistry, that means your car will start. These depend on explanatory models and data from experience.
                  There are no physical models of "nothing" that prohibit creation, and no data from experience to say 'something cannot come from nothing'. Therefore, the inductive argument in the parent claim fails.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.4.3. Con:
              The laws of nature upon which all scientific evidence and common experience are based did not exist during the first 10^-43 seconds of the universe. Thus we have no plausible grounds for induction regarding anything that happened during or before that period.

            1.1.9.3.5.2.5. Con:
            There is a priori no good reason why a sheer origination of things, not determined by anything, should be unacceptable, whereas the existence of a god with the power to create something out of nothing is acceptable.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.5.1. Con:
              This doesn’t make it plausible to think that something could really come into being without a cause.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.5.2. Con:
              Believing that something cannot come from nothing is at the very least more plausible than its denial.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.5.2.1. Con:
                The 'more plausible than its negation' argument is problematic because it assumes (a) that probability can be assigned to the claim and (b) that 50.1% confidence is sufficient to move on from.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.5.2.2. Con:
                Where the negation of one claim logically implies another, the question is which of the two is the least implausible, not merely how implausible one of them is.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.5.3. Con:
              There must be a genuine reason to doubt, and just because we can doesn't mean we should. What we do know logically and from common experience and scientific observation is that "something from something" else. Since anything exists at all then, something is eternal. Too, creatio ex nihilo isn't ex nihilo nihil fit. Moreover, creatio ex se completely avoids the inconsistency.

            1.1.9.3.5.2.6. Con:
            In quantum physics, subatomic particles (virtual particles) come into being from nothing. Moreover, there are theories of the origin of the universe that get something from nothing.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.6.1. Con:
              Many physicists today are quite dissatisfied with this view of quantum physics and are exploring deterministic theories.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.6.2. Con:
              Even on the traditional, indeterministic interpretation, particles do not come into being out of nothing. They arise as spontaneous fluctuations of the energy contained in the sub-atomic vacuum, which constitutes an indeterministic cause of their origination.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.6.3. Con:
              Theories of the origin of the universe out of a primordial vacuum  involve a sea of fluctuating energy endowed with a rich structure and subject to physical laws. This is not origination out of nothing.

                1.1.9.3.5.2.6.3.1. Con:

              1.1.9.3.5.2.6.4. Con:
              Vilenkin’s model of quantum creation equates the initial state of the universe explanatorily prior to tunneling with nothingness. This equivalence is patently mistaken because the quantum tunneling is at every point a function from something to something.

            1.1.9.3.5.2.7. Con:
            If something cannot come from nothing, then the universe must be made from antecedent material.

              1.1.9.3.5.2.7.1. Con:
              Antecedent material is not nothing and there can be nothing prior to nothing.

          1.1.9.3.5.3. Con:

          1.1.9.3.5.4. Con:
          The existence of "nothing" is possible as a conjecture, as is any aspect of metaphysics (e.g. the existence of a omniscient and omnipotent supernatural being).

          1.1.9.3.5.5. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.3.1.

        1.1.9.3.7. Pro:
        P2. The number of past events in the universe cannot be actually infinite.

          1.1.9.3.7.1. Con:

          1.1.9.3.7.2. Con:

          1.1.9.3.7.3. Pro:
          It is impossible for an actual infinity to exist in the real world because it would result in absurdities [421].

            1.1.9.3.7.3.1. Con:
            Actual infinities might exist without these absurdities if only finite portions of them are accessible. For example, space may be infinite in extent, but we can only interact with our finite Hubble volume [422].

            1.1.9.3.7.3.2. Con:
            The slope of a vertical line is infinite. There is nothing physically absurd about this.

            1.1.9.3.7.3.3. Con:
            In the Standard Model, electrons are point particles. They are infinitely small.

              1.1.9.3.7.3.3.1. Con:
              This is complicated by the wave/particle duality and Heisenberg uncertainty principle in quantum mechanics. i.e. the supposedly "infinitesimal" particles still take up finite space.

              1.1.9.3.7.3.3.2. Con:
              String theory suggests that elementary particles do have some (extremely small) spatial extension. Zero-dimensional points are merely a mathematical approximation in our models that break down if you examine them too closely.

            1.1.9.3.7.3.4. Con:
            Then it's impossible for God to exist in the real world since God needs to be infinite to be omniscient [423]: "Given that God is all knowing God knows the first prime number that has a billion digits, trillion digits, and all prime numbers beyond that [...], that alone can indicate that God has infinite processing power. If God has infinite anything, that would require that God is also infinite." But God would need to be finite to be in the real world (And if It's outside, It doesn't exist).

            1.1.9.3.7.3.5. Con:
            Hilbert's Hotel and related paradoxes show only that actual infinities are counter-intuitive, not that they are impossible.

              1.1.9.3.7.3.5.1. Pro:
              The mathematics of infinite sets are logically well defined. That's why we can do math on them.

                1.1.9.3.7.3.5.1.1. Con:
                In the universe of mathematics where we establish certain rules to govern that world, yes we can do math with infinite sets. Yet, bringing this into the real world results in logical absurdities. Therefore, the fact that we can do math in a universe with special rules does nothing to demonstrate that there can be such things as actual infinities.

            1.1.9.3.7.3.6. Con:
            actually, it isn't impossible. again, that actual infinities may lead to rational absurdity doesn't entail to actual infinities being impossible. it is an argument to negative consequence; that absurdity must equate to impossibility. that there can't be actual infinities requires justification too. neither are evidential assertions and both are rationally possible. therefore, either is actually possible.

          1.1.9.3.7.4. Con:
          In modern set theory, the use of actual infinite sets is commonplace, thus actual infinities can occur.

            1.1.9.3.7.4.1. Con:
            While these actual infinities can occur in a universe of discourse for talking consistently about actual infinities, it doesn’t follow that an actual infinite number of things can exist in reality.

              1.1.9.3.7.4.1.1. Pro:
              The universe of discourse for modern set theory is an entirely fictional realm.

              1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2. Pro:
              It is impossible for a quantitative actual infinity [424] to exist in the real world because it would result in logical absurdities [425].

                1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2.4. Con:
                God's "infinite" characteristics include the following, all of which can be expressed quantitatively, not qualitatively:
                Power (measured in Watts).
                Knowledge (measured in kilobytes of data stored)
                Thinking (measured in hertz)

                  1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2.4.1. Con:
                  Associating God’s omnipotence with watts is a misrepresentation. God’s power is not some energy force. Omnipotence is a qualitative attribute that means God can do anything that is logically possible.

                  1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2.4.2. Con:
                  God’s omniscience is not an infinite characteristic. It has a maximum level that usually includes all propositional knowledge. God is also attributed middle knowledge and personal knowledge of Himself by some theologians.

                  1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2.4.3. Con:
                  Because God is omniscient, He doesn’t think in the human sense of processing thoughts. Even God’s decisions are already known to Him, regardless of when He manifests them. Hertz are irrelevent.

                1.1.9.3.7.4.1.2.5. Con:
                -> See 1.1.9.3.7.3.5.

              1.1.9.3.7.4.1.3. Con:
              The concept of infinity is beyond us and we can’t understand it.

                1.1.9.3.7.4.1.3.1. Con:
                Infinite set theory is a highly developed and well understood branch of mathematics. The absurdities when thought out in reality occur because we do understand the nature of the actual infinite.

          1.1.9.3.7.5. Pro:
          You can’t pass through an infinite number of elements one at a time. You can’t count to infinity or from infinity. This shows that the series of past events must be finite and have a beginning.

            1.1.9.3.7.5.1. Con:
            There are an infinity of fractions between any two numbers, as illustrated by Zenos paradoxes [426]. Yet somehow distances do get crossed.

              1.1.9.3.7.5.1.1. Con:
              Just because spacial distances are conveniently modeled by numbers, it does not follow that space is infinitely divisible. There are good physical reasons [427] to think it is not.

                1.1.9.3.7.5.1.1.1. Con:
                There are also good physical reasons to suppose that space is a continuum.

              1.1.9.3.7.5.1.2. Con:
              This confuses the idea of an actual infinite with the idea of a potential infinite. A mathematical line can only be a potential infinite. It’s impossible for an actually infinite series of points on a line or an infinitely long line to exist.

                1.1.9.3.7.5.1.2.1. Con:
                Even a finite line segment still has an infinity of points on it. Traveling along a line means touching all of them. Clearly an infinity of points from there didn't stop you from getting here. Thus, the objection that it's impossible to pass though an infinity of points to reach the present is invalid.

                  1.1.9.3.7.5.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  A finite line is a faulty comparison. Though divisible into infinite points, this does not change that it has two finite endpoints. Time as an eternal line would have no endpoints.

                    1.1.9.3.7.5.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                    Then assume an open interval [428]. Endpoints have zero length anyway, so removing them doesn't change the finite length.

            1.1.9.3.7.5.2. Con:
            If you think of time as a dimension [429], then a worldline [430] can pass through an infinity of points--because it's already there.

            1.1.9.3.7.5.3. Con:
            Even a beginningless past, every event in the past is only a finite distance from the present. If we make the present zero and pick a negative point in the past(-10 or -1,000,000), the finite distance from these points is easily crossed to arrive at the present.

              1.1.9.3.7.5.3.1. Con:
              Just because every finite part of a series can be crossed or counted down doesn’t mean the whole infinite series can be crossed or counted. The parent commits the fallacy of composition.

            1.1.9.3.7.5.4. Con:
            It is perfectly possible to pass through an infinite number of events one at a time, provided that you never began the process but have always been doing it.

          1.1.9.3.7.6. Pro:
          All Caused Things must have a Cause. Since an eternal regression of causes requires that the sum of all existence, as a whole, to be uncaused, and a finite regression of causes requires that the start of the regression be uncaused, it is necessary that an uncaused cause exists.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.1. Con:
            Even if you were granted validity to the Cosmological Argument, you still must prove that the uncaused cause is an intelligence with agency. Even then you've still done nothing to prove the existence of a particular god.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.1.1. Con:
              -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.2.2.1.2.1.1.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.2. Con:
            False dichotomy. It does not follow that a finite regression requires the start to be uncaused. e.g. the chain of causality could be circular and finite [431]. Circles do not have "ends" or "beginnings", but over a small distance still look linear.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.2.1. Con:
              If time was circular, some event E would have to be before itself and after itself at the same time. This is absurd.

                1.1.9.3.7.6.2.1.1. Con:
                It only SEEMS absurd from a naiive point of view. In fact, closed timelike curves [432] (or "jinn particles") are possibilities seriously considered by physicists.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.2.2. Con:
              Even if a starting point wouldn't follow necessarily, it still would be the preferable option, because it avoids unnecessary ad hocs.

                1.1.9.3.7.6.2.2.1. Con:
                Positing an absolute beginning doesn't avoid ad hocs at all. You have to make an exception to the rule that every effect has a cause. That's ad hoc.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.3. Con:
            -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.7.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.4. Con:
            From observations about causality in the universe, an object or agent has two options in becoming a cause:
            (1) Act upon itself, and therefore alter or destroy itself to affect an effect. In this case, even if God was a cause, it may not still exist.
            (2) Act upon another object to affect an effect. But the proposition of a 'first cause' assumes no other objects exist.
            
            Either way, the argument cannot lead us to the conclusion a God still exists (or ever existed).

              1.1.9.3.7.6.4.1. Con:
              Creation out of nothing is not impossible for an omnipotent God. If God is the efficient cause of the universe, there is nothing incoherent about saying God brought all matter into existence at the moment of creation.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.4.2. Con:
              The parent is a false dilemma. It assumes creatio ex nihilo is impossible for God.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.5. Con:
            Causation relies on the concept of time. The most accredited theory about the beginning of the universe implies that time began with the Big Bang. Therefore, there is no cause.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.5.1. Con:
              Causation is (mostly) understood in time, but does not rely on it. Time measures events. Causation explains events. The beginning of time is an event and therefore a requires an explanation and cause. God is commonly understood as infinite and unchanging, therefore does not need a cause.

                1.1.9.3.7.6.5.1.1. Con:
                -> See 1.1.7.4.17.1.1.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.6. Con:
            No god required. The cause could be any sufficient entity, show that a god or even the "uncaused cause" is necessary.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.7. Con:
            The premise that the universe was "caused" is an assumption. It is possible that the universe has always existed as an uncaused phenomena.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.7.1. Con:
              The 2nd law of thermodynamics mitigates against an eternal universe.

              1.1.9.3.7.6.7.2. Con:
              Such an uncaused universe would be a God. It would inherently be omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.

                1.1.9.3.7.6.7.2.1. Con:
                Omnipotence, Omniscience and Omnibenevolence are assumed to be attributes of a God. There is no objective basis for these assumptions. These qualities are also contradictory in that the presence of evil refutes the possibility of such a deity possessing all three.

                This is just trying to define a god into existence by redefining it as an uncaused universe. This attempt can simply be rejected as easily as it's asserted.

                1.1.9.3.7.6.7.2.3. Con:
                All evolutionary processes are the process of seemingly inconsequential things becoming increasingly complex. Causes do not have to be as "great" as their effects. So, if a natural process were responsible for the universe, if would not follow that natural process is "omni"-anything. It is possible that it is remarkable simple.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.8. Con:
            This "uncaused cause" doesn't have to be a sentient, living, immortal, omnipotent being endowed with volition, thoughts, etc.

            1.1.9.3.7.6.9. Con:
            There are cosmogonies that include time starting at the "Big Bang", but include nontemporal hyperinflation stages as causes to this. This removes the "infinite regress" problem but removing time from a region of the universe expanding faster than the speed of light (and forbidding causation, due to relativistic limits).

            1.1.9.3.7.6.10. Con:
            The uncaused caused could be a natural/physical/material process, ultimately understandable by science. Or, it could be that a God had to use itself up to create the universe, and therefore now does not exist. In short, the "uncaused first cause" argument tells us nothing about the cause, especially whether it is divine.

              We can deduce many attributes about the uncaused first cause.

                    The parent is correct. Yet, all this would accomplish is kicking the problem up a level for as soon as you posit a physical explanation for our universe, this assumes a spacio-temporal realm that exists for that cause. Thus, we can immediately ask, “what is the explanation of this higher level universe?” If one keeps positing physical explanations, one simply ends up in an infinite regress of universes. Therefore, the ultimate explanation cannot be physical.

                  This is because any two points of the hyperinflating spacetime are travelling apart from each other faster than light, and so causation cannot take place and therefore there are no events.youtu.be [433]

        P3. The universe is all of space-time reality and includes all matter and energy. Thus, if the universe has a cause of its existence, that cause must be non-physical and immaterial because it transcends space and time. There are only two kinds of things we know of that could fall under such a description: either abstract objects (like a number) or else a mind (a soul, a self). Abstract objects that we know of don’t stand in causal relations. Therefore, a mind is a better explanation.

                Using the word “retrieve” to represent this study is misleading. Subjects were shown 300 images of faces which created brain activity that was then captured and mapped. When a subject was shown a new photo, the researchers were able to construct an image similar to what was being shown. At most this demonstrates that the same regions of the brain are used for visual query. No retrieval occurred. Moreover, the linked source doesn’t make it clear if there was consistent mapping subject to subject.

These can continue to be accepted as meaningful within context of that construct.

        1.1.9.3.19. Con:
        What is meant by "universe" is unclear.

          1.1.9.3.19.1. Pro:
          The Friedman equations -- which are used to establish a 'beginning -- when extrapolated backwards, only take us back until Relativistic equations break down. At this point, there is a hot, dense, "quark soup" in spacetime. If "Universe" means 'all that is derived from that moment', then there may still be antecedent matter.

            1.1.9.3.19.1.1. Con:
            All space-time reality would include any antecedent matter to that moment.

        1.1.9.3.20. Con:
        Al-Ghazali's Argument speaks to a chain of causation, and if accepted, implies a deterministic universe. This conflicts with the Abrahamic traditions' acceptance of free will in their faithful, as free will cannot exist in a deterministic universe. Being of the Abrahamic tradition, the Argument represents a logical conflict between the nature of a Creation Event, and the nature of the faithful's adherence to dogma. Therefore, theists who hold that we have free will cannot use this argument

          1.1.9.3.20.1. Con:
          The parent assumes determinism to be true and thus begs the question.

        1.1.9.3.21. Con:
        Basically the universe is a set of matter and energy. The fact that the universe had a start doesn´t necessarily mean that matter itself had a start, as far as we know matter or energy can´t be created therefore they don´t need a cause.

        1.1.9.3.22. Con:
        The fact that the universe had a cause for its existence when it began to exist does not imply that this cause still exists.

        1.1.9.3.23. Con:
        "This cause must be transcendent...[et al]" this conclusion is faulty, a non-sequitur. It jumps from premise 3 without any valid justifications nor provides evidence as to how did transcendent being "caused" the universe. It assumes that everyone "ought" to know that your God created the Universe and we must agree with it. It adds more questions like, "how did you know that your God was 'uncaused'", "did you observe your God creating the Universe?", "Why does it have to be a personal God?"

      1.1.9.4. Pro:
      -> See discussion #18656: The universe is a "book" with an Author.

      1.1.9.5. Con:
      This is a logical fallacy most commonly known as the God of the Gaps. Just because no one currently has information on a specific event does not mean that the supernatural is the correct. For ex. In ancient times, people did not have a scientific explanation for thunder. Therefore they concluded it must be Thor because it is the best explanation. This line of reasoning is incredibly fallacious.

        1.1.9.5.1. Con:
        It is not fallacious to refer to God as the best explanation for it doesn’t say God is the only possible explanation.

      1.1.9.6. Con:
      Whether or not God is "the best" explanation for the beginning of the universe depends on personal preference and is by no means universal.

      1.1.9.7. Pro:
      The limits of the universe show that the Cause of the Universe, being the Creator, must be infinite, if He is to implement an infinite diversity of limits (measurements) in this seemingly infinite world. Because our universe is definite, in so many infinite ways (with everything being calculable), it stands to reason there must be an infinite designer capable of doing seemingly anything. Therefore, God is the only answer.

        1.1.9.7.1. Con:
        There is nothing that cannot be plausibly explained without God. Therefore, we have no need of that hypothesis [436].

          1.1.9.7.1.1. Con:
          The parent is a non sequitur. Even if we grant the claim, the conclusion doesn’t follow.

          1.1.9.7.1.2. Pro:
          History of human knowledge includes a lot of things once attributed to God -- harvests, disease, sunrise, thunder, luck, rain -- which now have secular explanations.
          One thing this should teach is to be cautious of arguments from ignorance.
          But it should also provide inductive reasons for assuming that, even if a God exists, It should not interact with the universe.

            1.1.9.7.1.3.2. Pro:
            While science has a greater and greater understanding of DNA, RNA, and the molecular mechanisms that build these structures that's as far as they can get. They can study them and even synthesize the parts. What is so desperately out of reach is how to give them LIFE.

              1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2. Pro:
              Life as we know it is cellular, made up of an information carrying macromolecule encapsulated in a self-assembling membrane, with the capacity to replicate itself and transfer heritable information. We cannot create a genome from scratch. We can obviously observe what is already alive and study it but so far it hasn't been repeated. And any hypothesis must be testable under the conditions of early earth.

                1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.1. Con:
                We CAN create genomes from scratch [439]. A group from the J. Craig Venter Institute synthesized the genome of the bacterium Mycoplasma mycoides from a computer record and transplanted it into an existing cell of Mycoplasma capricolum that had had its DNA removed. (A cell without DNA is effectively dead.) The new part-synthetic cell was then alive and was able to replicate itself billions of times.
                
                Life is just chemistry.

                  1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.1.1. Con:
                  The J. Craig Venter Institute took existing genes put them together and inserted them into an existing cell. Using schematics from a computer record of an existing genome.This is not creating a synthetic genome from scratch. Two paragraphs into the link states that this is not synthetic life.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                    The group synthesized the genes chemically in pieces up to about 1,000 base pairs long. This was a purely chemical process outside of any living organism. The pieces were then assembled using engineered bacteria and yeast.

                1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2. Con:
                Repeatability doesn't mean we need to create life over and over again from scratch. For a model (hypothesis) to be testable it has to predict the occurence of phenomena. Some of these phenomena need to be repeatable, not the model itself.

                  1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2.1. Pro:
                  The science of abiogenesis has many competing model hypotheses on the origin of life that are testable in this sense.

                  1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2.2. Pro:
                  Another example is the theory of the Big Bang. The Big Bang itself is obviously not repeatable, however the predictions of the model are testable and repeatable.

                  1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2.3. Con:
                  The theory of the big bang is not testable. We know from background radiation that all things in the universe are moving away from a single point and each other, but what causèd that is still a debatable subject among scientist. The many competing model hypotheses on the origin of life are then all predictable and then testable. Yet only one can be right. This is why it must be repeatable before it's considered fact.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2.3.1. Con:
                    To test something means you take the predictions a hypothesis makes and you see if the observations match the predictions. The logic of the parent claim seems to suggest that the only way to test something is to go back in time and be there when it happened or to completely recreate the event. This is not how the scientific method works and is nonsense.

                      1.1.9.7.1.3.2.2.2.3.1.1. Con:
                      Scientific Method- question, research, hypothesis, a fair test with an Experiment when possible, trouble shoot,  test, analyze. If life began naturally despite overwhelming odds (scientists agree) using the basic building blocks then science should at some point be able to replicate this process.

              1.1.9.7.1.3.2.3. Con:
              The claim that that is as far as science CAN get desperately needs PROOF. The fact that science has not yet got further is not proof.

              1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4. Pro:
              The claim that science will be able to create life as we know it rests on faith in science itself. We can only prove what is verifiable now.

                1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1. Con:
                No one here claimed that they know scientists will be able to create life. What was claimed was that there is nothing that cannot be explained without god. We have hypotheses about the origins of life which do not include god. We do not know which explanation is right but their mere existence means that it can be explained without god.

                  1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1. Con:
                  The mere existence of a possible explanation is not proof that another possible explanation (God) is wrong. Panspermia is another possible explanation. ID scientists have their own explanation. Who knows. Good science should not be biased. All ideas should have a seat at the table. Neo-darwinism only promotes free thought within its own narrow framework. There is much we don't know. Maybe all of the explanations including God are wrong.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.1. Con:
                    The grandparent said nothing about proof or that another explanation was wrong. It said it can be explained without god which is literally all the head of the branch says.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.2. Con:
                    There is no branch of science called Intelligent Design (ID). There are no ID scientists.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.3. Con:
                    Good science should not be biased. Accepting ridiculous and long disproven ideas like intelligent design would be biased science.

                      1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.3.1. Pro:
                      Not all claims in science are equaly plausible and thus can not be treated as equal alternatives.

                      1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.3.2. Pro:
                      In Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District [440], the court ruled that Intelligent Design is Religion, not Science.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.4. Con:
                    Disproven ideas should not have a seat at the table and claim that they aren't disproven. That leads to confusion, disarray, chaos, and the post-truth era we are living in currently.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.5. Con:
                    Neo-Darwinism is an interpretation of the theory of evolution. Neo-Darwinism is absolutely not a theory of what 'free thought' should consist of.

                    1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.6. Pro:
                    Scientists who support the ID claim : Ralph Seekle, Scott Minnich, Wolf-Ekkehard Lonnig, Guillermo Gonzalez. These are reputable scientists that have risked ridicule from the scientific community. There are more that are more well known for their support of ID but I'm sure they are well known to anyone curious enough to read and listen to all sides of a discussion.

                      1.1.9.7.1.3.2.4.1.1.6.1. Con:
                      Ad verecundiam [441]. The claim that a handful of "reputable scientists" support ID is a very weak argument. The pronouncement of competent authority is, of course, Bayesian evidence [442], but "the scientific community" is at least as authoritative and contradicts them. And more direct argument screens off any authority [443].

            1.1.9.7.1.3.3. Con:
            There are no non-physical aspects of human life simply the illusion or delusion that there are non-physical aspects. The human brain is very skilled at tricking itself. It creates false senses, false memories, false experiences, false beliefs etc.

            1.1.9.7.1.3.4. Con:
            Abiogenesis [444] is the process of how life came to be and there are several possible explanations given for it none of which require god.

          1.1.9.7.1.4. Pro:
          To exist is to be in this Universe. A being outside of the universe would not interact with it. All evidence until now suggests that either there is no god or it does not interact with the universe. (So, no reason to assume its existence.)

          1.1.9.7.1.5. Con:
          How do you know that everything can be plausibly explained? If there are things, which quantum mechanics tells us we cannot know them, how do you know that there are not also things without explanation? Uncertainty Principle [445]

          1.1.9.7.1.6. Con:
          There can be many alternative explanations for the existence of something, that does not mean one explanation is obsolete based on the existence of other possibilities.

        1.1.9.7.2. Con:
        An infinite amount of things is, by definition, unable to be experienced. Therefore, we cannot know that our universe is truly infinite.

        1.1.9.7.3. Con:
        Great complexity can emerge from very simple rules. Thus the "Cause of the Universe" may be something simple and mindless. They why call it God?

          1.1.9.7.3.1. Pro:
          Conway's Game of Life has just four simple rules [446]. Yet it defines a Universe rich enough to build complex machines [447], even computers [448].

          1.1.9.7.3.2. Con:
          The reason it cannot be something mindless is because there is a meaning to the universe. If there is a meaning there must be something with a mind that created it.

            1.1.9.7.3.2.1. Con:
            That the universe has meaning to humans only requires that humans have minds. That the universe has inherent meaning (absent humans--or analogous minds) has not been demonstrated.

            1.1.9.7.3.2.2. Con:
            It does not follow that "purpose" (or apparent purpose) must be the result of intelligent design. Biology is an excellent counterexample. Biological systems do have functions and systems to carry them out, but that's only because organisms that could not do so fail to replicate, and so are less prevalent.

    1.1.10. Pro:
    God is the best explanation for the applicability of mathematics [449] to the physical world.

      1.1.10.1. Con:
      Mathematics and science cannot explain the existence of many things (e. g. love, the soul, God).

        1.1.10.1.1. Con:
        The fact that mathematics and science cannot explain everything does not provide an explanation why parts of mathematics do apply to reality (e.g. those areas chiefly studied by physics).

      1.1.10.2. Con:
      Most of the mathematical world is not applicable to the natural world.

        1.1.10.2.1. Pro:
        The higher reaches of set theory and higher orders of transfinite arithmetic are incapable of being physically realized, and so the world does not exhibit such a structure.

        1.1.10.2.2. Con:
        Recognizing that most of the mathematical world is not applicable to the natural world does not provide an explanation why parts of mathematics do apply to reality (e.g. those areas chiefly studied by physics).

      1.1.10.3. Con:
      The reason for the unnaturally neat correlation between math and the physical world is down to evolution: the ones to see the link between the two are the ones most likely to survive.

        1.1.10.3.1. Con:
        Granted that the creatures most likely to survive are the ones who can discern mathematics’ applicability to nature, the question still remains: Why is mathematics’ applicability to nature there to be discerned in the first place? Evolution doesn’t address that question.

      1.1.10.4. Con:
      If we live in a mathematical universe [450], there is no question of the applicability of mathematics to the physical world, because they're the same thing.

The only reason left for denying that Jesus performed literal miracles is the presupposition of anti-supernaturalism, which is simply unjustified.

          The parent misclassifies the gospels as fiction. They were autobiographies consistent with the genre of the time.

            1.1.11.6.1.2.1. Con:
            The grandparent does not classify the gospels as simply fiction. The book Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter which was referenced in the claim is classified as  a "biographical action horror mash-up novel." The analogy to the bible grants that the bible has historical and biographical elements combined with fanciful exaggeration.

        1.1.11.6.2. Con:
        The Bible can be cited as evidence so long as the evidence isn't "the Bible says it so I believe it." 
        
        For example, the Bible mentions certain figures and claims that they are historical persons. If it is demonstrated that those people did not live then this counts as evidence against the Bible.
        
        If you can use historical persons as evidence against the Bible then it can be used for the Bible.

      Jesus rising from the dead would not count as evidence that he is God. At best, if we assume it to be true, it would only suggest that Jesus had miraculous powers.

        1.1.11.7.1. Con:
        If we view his resurrection in isolation from the religio-historical context then yes that is all we would conclude. However, when one considers his miracles, his predictions that came true, His personal claim to be God, and the prophecies He fulfilled, the resurrection becomes the culmination of a large body of evidence that this man really was God in human form.

          1.1.11.7.1.1. Con:
          Each of these points need to be demonstrated with their own evidence before counting as evidence for the existence of God.

            1.1.11.7.1.1.1. Pro:
            The New Testament is an unreliable collection of documents. The New Testament has as many or more variations of words as it does words. For the Gospels the original texts (thought to be written in Aramaic) are lost. 
            
            The copyists were known to be mostly illiterate.
            
            Transcriptions of the New Testament were often filled with errors.

            1.1.11.7.1.1.2. Pro:
            It is unclear that Jesus himself ever claimed to be God.

            1.1.11.7.1.1.3. Pro:
            The prophecies the Jesus "fulfilled" are highly contended against. An in context reading destroy many of the prophecies as support for Jesus as Messiah or God. Reading the prophecies in Hebrew destroy many of the other claims.

      1.1.11.8. Pro:
      Jesus divinity can be validated through the empty tomb. The 1st and 2nd Century historians Josephus [454] and Tacitus write about Jesus, his execution by Pilate, and the growth of Christianity. It is indeed historical fact that Christ was executed by the Romans. He was also publicly entombed in the grave belonging to Joseph of Arimathea. Everyone knew where his body was buried, and it was guarded, but could not produce a corpse after claims of the resurrection started spreading.

        1.1.11.8.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.8.4.6.

        1.1.11.8.2. Con:
        The Josephus accounts are weak as they are contested in scholarly circles and even if we accept the reference to Jesus their value is very limited. 
        
        The Josephus exerts do not count towards support of Jesus's divinity. The most important part about Jesus rising from the dead is actually the portion of the Testimonium Flavianum that is believed to be inauthentic and a later interpolation by Christians.

    -> See 1.1.9.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.4.2.

    1.1.13. Con:
    If God exists, then He is powerful enough to create a reality in which we live but provides no proof of His existence. Therefore, it is futile to try to prove God's existence.

      1.1.13.1. Con:
      Faith is a defective epistemology. It can justify false things as easily as true ones.

        1.1.13.1.1. Con:
        Under the Christian view of “faith,” Christ’s representatives are commanded by scripture to use their minds to discern truth (Matthew 22:37, 2 Timothy 3:16, 1 Timothy 4:13, 15-16, Ephesians 5:15-17). Christian faith includes an intellectual pursuit of who God is, the world He created, and the reasons for our faith (1 Peter 3:15). Reason and logic are necessary to accomplish this task.

      1.1.13.2. Con:
      -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.

      1.1.13.3. Con:
      Just because God may be powerful enough to create a reality that provides no proof of His existence, it does not follow that He will.

      1.1.13.4. Pro:
      Almost all religions including Christianity are saying that "it is a fact that seeing all the exactness in nature proofs Gods existence" Romans 1:20 [455], Psalm 97:6 [456], Psalm 19:1 [457]

    1.1.14. Pro:
    Our own speech, even often involuntarily, acknowledges the existence of God.

      1.1.14.1. Con:
      Those names existed before the Bible was written. Those people already had those names before they allegedly encountered God or Jesus and thus were written about in the bible.

      1.1.14.2. Con:
      I say holy Batman, then Batman must exist also by acknowledgement

      1.1.14.3. Con:
      It is not unusual for people to name their children after fictional characters, and they need not assume those characters ever existed.

      1.1.14.4. Con:
      All cultures which have religious or supernatural belief systems make reference to their deities or supernatural beings within speech. If all linguistic references meant that everything refered to necessarily existed, then all belief systems would be equally valid.

      1.1.14.5. Con:
      We say that "the Sun rises", and yet we know it is the Earth that turns. Our language was created over the ages by people who knew less that we do, yet we must speak a common language or we can't be understood.

      1.1.14.6. Pro:
      The existence of God is real because people talk about God. As long as people talk about God and fight about his existence or non-existence he actually exists in human minds, thoughts and lives.

        1.1.14.6.1. Con:
        That the "concept of God" exists is not in dispute. Theists manifestly exist. That's not at all the same as saying "God Exists". By analogy, the concepts of pink unicorns and fire-breathing dragons exist (clearly, you understand the words and could recognize them in pictures). But that doesn't mean you can find one in the real world.

          1.1.14.6.1.1. Con:
          The description of the thesis doen't specify what kind of existence. So it could be platonist existence in a world of ideals.

        1.1.14.6.2. Con:
        The fact that thoughts and conversations "exist" does not mean that the thing we are thinking or talking about about exists.

        1.1.14.6.3. Con:
        People talk about things that don't exist.

        1.1.14.6.4. Con:
        The idea of god does exist. But ideas of things are not the actual things.

      1.1.14.7. Pro:
      To genuinely remove the existence of God from our language would rule out even jokingly remarking, "Oh my God!" It would also mean replacing words like 'creature', and, abandoning fashionable names, such as Noah, David, John, Luke, Mark, Simon, Peter and Matthew, in exchange for names not suggested to us by a Bible whose credibility we dispute because it suggests the existence of God, using some other naming convention.

      1.1.14.8. Pro:
      It is not just the writings of Genesis, but, the way the lives of even its skeptics reflect it. The instinct of women to want to be 'given away' by their fathers, and to hope to be greeted by a stunned facial expression on the man prom night or wedding day, mimics Genesis 2:22-23. It is rarely articulated more clearly than the nearly rhetorical "How do I look?" followed by the mandatory "You look great." It's an instinctive, genetic, sub-conscious re-enactment of Genesis, not a genuine inquiry.

        1.1.14.8.1. Con:
        The fact that a literary work influenced pop culture and the way we view the world, supposing the idea that the text referenced applies, doesn't prove the truth of it's words or the existence of its characters.

  1.2. Pro:
  There are valid ways we can know God exists.

    1.2.1. Pro:
    People claim a personal experience with God. Therefore, God exists.

      1.2.1.1. Con:
      People have a personal experience of religious phenomena that are incompatible with a personal god, such as pantheism, or any god at all such as Buddhist anatta (no-self/soul). [458]

      1.2.1.2. Con:
      Without doubting the quality or character of the experience you had, it is still not possible to confirm your explanation of that experience. 
      That is to say that you may well have had a profound-feeling argument, but that does not tell us the cause is God.

        1.2.1.2.1. Pro:
        There is a difference between knowing God exists and showing that God exists.

        1.2.1.2.2. Con:
        While it doesn’t demonstrate to others that God exists, an experience of God can still lead to personal knowledge of His existence that is properly warranted [459].

          1.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
          People have personal experiences of alien abduction and other Gods. We know these kinds of experiences do not lead to warranted beliefs as they can lead to contradictory beliefs.

          1.2.1.2.2.2. Con:
          One cannot know with absolute certainty that any perceived experiences of god are not really a part of some advanced virtual reality simulation. Therefore, personal experience wouldn't prove the existence of god.

            1.2.1.2.2.2.1. Con:
            On this epistemological standard we are not warranted in believing in anything. One cannot know with absolute certainty that any perceived experiences whatsoever are not really a part of some advanced virtual reality simulation. Therefore, personal experience wouldn't prove the existence of anything.

              1.2.1.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
              It wouldn't be the case that you wouldn't be able to believe in anything under this standard. You would be justified in believing that certain patterns of outcomes are likely to lead to a predictable result. If everything were a simulation it would still be apparent there are certain consistent rules that the simulation doesn't appear to deviate from. You can know the properties of your memories as some defined information packet at the very least.

                1.2.1.2.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                All knowledge would be a deception of the designer and thus we couldn’t have confidence in any belief.

            1.2.1.2.2.2.2. Con:
            If reality were part of an advanced virtual reality simulation, this leads to the question, “who designed the simulation?”

              1.2.1.2.2.2.2.1. Con:
              Sure, but why call the designer "God"? Maybe naturally evolved humans built the machines that built The Matrix.

                1.2.1.2.2.2.2.1.1. Con:
                The parent just kicks the problem up to the current level of conversation. Thus, postulating we are in a virtual simulation that there is zero evidence for and is not even a properly basic belief isn’t very helpful except to say that we can’t really know anything with certainty. That isn’t very profound.

      1.2.1.3. Pro:
      In Christianity, experience of the Holy Spirit is veridical and unmistakable (though not necessarily irresistible or indubitable) for him who has it; such a person does not need supplementary arguments or evidence in order to know and to know with confidence that he is in fact experiencing the Spirit of God.

        1.2.1.3.1. Con:
        Attributing your experience to "God" is an unwarranted assumption. Other explanations are far more probable.

          1.2.1.3.1.1. Pro:
          If "evidence" of a thing is as likely to appear when the thing is present as when it is absent, then it is not evidence the thing is present.
          
          If you had been raised in India and had such an experience, the people around you may have told you it was evidence for Krishna, and you would have believed it was Krishna. If spiritual experiences can just as easily be attributed to other gods, they are not evidence for any god in particular.

          You only call it "God" because other people told you that it was. But they did not share your subjective experience and could be mistaken about the cause of their own spiritual experiences.

        1.2.1.3.2. Con:
        Such a view makes any belief or opinion plausible.

        1.2.1.3.3. Con:
        It is possible that experience of the holy spirit is a cognitive bias in that one wishes it existed and ones experience is entirely confined to their own mind. How would one tell the difference between the experience of a real external entity or an internal cognitive experience? There is no way to tell and therefore the above claim is not reliable evidence of the existence of God.

      1.2.1.4. Con:
      One could believe. 'I have experiences flying pigs personally' this does not mean flying pigs exist.

      1.2.1.7. Con:
      The cause of your experience is unknown and cannot be verified. It could be a hallucination or a mistake. (I'm sure people who accept their experience as evidence for their God recognise this mistake in other people's experiences for other Gods.)

      1.2.1.9. Con:
      First person revelation is not a reliable epistemology to determine existence because many people experience mutually exclusive gods or entities that assert other gods don’t exist.

        A proposition that cannot be empirically verified is not necessarily false. It may be true.

      1.2.1.12. Con:
      This is an absolutely circular argument. Believing that you experienced god personally implied that you already believe in god. If you did not believe in god to begin with perhaps your explanation of your experience would be very different.

      -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.10.

      1.2.1.14. Con:
      It is possible for people to experience something and mis-attribute the experience to be that of something other than that which was actually experienced, and then claim that the "something else" exists.

      1.2.1.15. Con:
      People claim a personal experience with God, but often doubt his existence.

      1.2.1.16. Con:
      People lie.

      1.2.1.17. Con:
      People can be fooled or mistaken.

      1.2.1.18. Pro:
      A fundamental characteristic of an individual is that they can perceive truth. This is logical but axiomatic. Any claims to the contrary become nonsensical because the claimant cannot perceive the own truth of their statements.
      
      With an intrinsic truth perception we can know God. Therefore a person's experience of God is sufficient to say God exists. We can only then verify if such a claim is correct.

        1.2.1.18.1. Con:
        An individual can percieve truth, but it does not follow from this that the experience of god is intrinsically true. It could as well be false.

        1.2.1.18.2. Con:
        A demonstrable characteristic of individuals is that their perceptions can be inaccurate, misinterpreted, and otherwise flawed. To know the truth of one's own perceptions requires confirmation from others. A person's experience of any thing is insufficient to verify that the thing exists.

        1.2.1.18.3. Con:
        Truth is not perceived directly [460], but inferred from evidence. Raw sense data is filtered through many layers of neural processing before it becomes a conscious interpretation. Ambiguous data can have ambiguous interpretations [461].

        1.2.1.18.4. Con:
        Humans do have an instinctive grasp of the rules logic, because it is necessary for language. But that does not mean they can perceive analytic truths directly either. Mathematical proofs can be hard to follow, and even correct proofs may take years of study by experts before we can be reasonably certain that they do not contain an error.

    1.2.3. Con:
    God is incomprehensible to man.

      1.2.3.1. Con:
      God is omnipotent and omniscient, therefore is able to reveal himself to man: at least to the extent that man is cabable of understanding Him.

      1.2.3.2. Con:
      Some aspects of God may not be fully comprehensible. However, it does not follow that man cannot comprehend God at all.

    1.2.4. Con:
    Conclusive evidence of G-d's existence is impossible and theologically unwanted as it would turn religion into science and deprive man of the free will to disbelieve.

    1.3.2. Pro:
    1 The Supernatural does not exist.
    2 "God" is defined as a Supernatural being.
    Therefore, God does not exist.

      1.3.2.6. Con:
      If the Supernatural does not exist, then Black Holes, singularities, Dark Matter, Dark Energy, consciousness, feelings, emotions, thinking process, do not exist either, as they cannot be defined or explained in the natural.

        1.3.2.6.1. Con:
        This is a non sequitur. Some of those things have already been at least partially explained but all of them have the potential to be explained using natural means whereas the supernatural by definition cannot be explained in the natural. Simply because we cannot explain things yet does not mean we never will, this is the god of the gaps fallacy.

    1.3.3. Pro:
    The existence of many religions implies there is no one true God.

      1.3.3.1. Con:
      A professor tells his students, “I will give an A to whomever guesses what is in my pocket.” He recieved a wide-array of answers. All incorrect. He repeated this activity for 20 years and across 5000 different students with the same result. Students concluded it was a sham. Yet, 1 student guessed “the hat” piece from the monopoly board game. The answer correct, the professor revealed the piece. Therefore, the multitude of answers did nothing to decrease the probability that there was an answer.

      1.3.3.2. Con:
      The parent falsely equivocates the probability of finding the real God with the probability that God exists. These are not the same thing.

      1.3.3.3. Con:

      1.3.6.2. Con:
      This assumes that methodological failure implies impossibility, i.e. that many have failed to conclusively prove the existence of god implies that the contrary is true. If this were to be true, absurd examples arise, viz. the lack of proof of quarks to people in the 1800s and earlier, despite the thousand years of search for a smallest unit, implies the nonexistence of quarks.

      1.3.6.3. Pro:
      The existence of god has been proposed and questioned since the beginning of human history. Much thought has been dedicated to it for so long. Statistically, it is very unlikely that he exists, because if he did, this wouldn't be much of a question anymore.

    1.3.7. Pro:
    For God as a creator to be real, there must be a creator or intelligent designer of this God. This is infinitely improbable.

      1.3.7.1. Pro:
      Many believe that God must exist as an answer to our complex human design.  However, if it is believed that due to human complexity we must have been designed...then God, as infinitely more complex, must have been designed too. Super beings designing other super beings is improbable and thus makes God's existence doubtful.

      1.3.9.1. Pro:
      Evolution (natural existence without the need for a Creator) as propounded by Charles Darwin & Alfred Russell is now a generally accepted scientific theory based on evidence (collections of fossils); it contradicts the concept that man was created by God which implies God may not exist.

      1.3.9.2. Pro:

        The Bible indicates a timeline for the universe of about 6,000 years.answersingenesis.org [463] Science has shown that the earth is 4.6 billion years old www.smithsonianmag.com [464] the Universe is 13.7 billion years old. This massive discrepancy gives credence to evolution and discredits the Bible's claims.

          The cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological arguments do not rely upon any evidence from the Bible.

          1.3.9.2.1.2. Con:
          Evolution and an old earth are not necessarily incompatible with the God of the Bible.

            1.3.9.2.1.2.1. Con:
            The time question is a big one. Evangelicals hold to a strict interpretation of the timeline presented in Genesis 1. All religions held to a short timeframe until science proved them wrong. Using a religious translated oral history to explain the existence of the world is outdated and inaccurate. Time is what allows evolution to happen. This fact goes completely against the Bible's story of creation.

              1.3.9.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
              There are about about a dozen interpretations of Genesis 1 [465] held by various evangelicals. Therefore, it is false that all evangelicals hold to a literal interpretation of Genesis 1.

            1.3.9.2.1.2.2. Pro:
            Once you move away from the literal, consecutive seven-day interpretation, Genesis 1 doesn’t really say anything about how God created life on earth [466]. The Genesis account doesn’t say anything about the mechanisms, if any, that God used in creating biological complexity.

            1.3.9.2.1.2.3. Pro:
            Many religion's creation myths are completely or partially allegorical, and as such, contradicting such myths does not reflect on the religions that possess them.

              1.3.9.2.1.2.3.1. Pro:
              The Bible has 2 separate creation myths that somewhat contradict each other in Genesis 1 and Genesis 2. The purpose of these stories is to make a point about the world and how God feels about it, not to say how it happened.

              1.3.9.2.1.2.3.2. Con:
              Anciently, people actually believed their religions [467], instead of just believing in them. Their religious beliefs were beliefs about the real world. There was no concept of religion being a "separate magisterium [468]" from science. This retreat only happened in modern times now that religion can be falsified [469].

                1.3.9.2.1.2.3.2.1. Con:
                This retreat is starting to be resolved as philosophers and scientists are starting to recognize that theology and science have always been allies [470]. During the last quarter century, a flourishing dialogue between science and theology has been going on in North America and Europe.

          1.3.9.2.1.3. Con:
          God can do in one minute what it takes evolution a million years to do. That is, if evolution would be a little more than a simple unproven and unprovable explanation, which is NOT.

            1.3.9.2.1.3.1. Con:
            -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.

          1.3.9.2.1.4. Con:
          The Bible can be considered accurate even if one does interpret Genesis 1 as a poetic summary communicating to a pre-Scientific world. One cannot expect the Bible, written by Ancients, to be a Quantum Physics, Evolutionary Biology, or Geology text.

        1.3.9.2.2. Con:
        The God of the Bible could be 100% false and one still could not conclude that no God exists on this fact alone.

          1.3.9.2.2.1. Pro:
          There are a range of possibilities for God, some covered in other religions such as Islam, or in other ideas such as deism.

      1.3.9.3. Con:
      Evolution only deals with the development of biological complexity from simple progenitors (not the origin of life), so it would still be conceivable that a God manifested such progenitors. It thus only provides evidence against the classical monotheistic faiths, which believe that organisms were created in their current form.

      1.3.9.4. Pro:
      Evolution implies that organisms evolved from simple progenitors and were not created in their modern form. Evolution thus implies that the monotheistic faiths are incorrect because such faiths believe that all organisms were created in their modern forms.

      1.3.9.5. Con:
      Evolution is a theory it does not explain the origin of the universe. In other words evolution did not create the universe, we need to answer 'what/who created the universe?'. Think of it this way, the universe began from a point of singularity, be it atom or whatever. There must be explanation for what created this universe because it is by nature finite & limited. Therefore, you need a causality for this existence since it is cannot create itself. A necessary being/entity is required.

      1.3.9.6. Pro:
      Evolution contradicts all religions creation myths. Therefore, there is no God.

        1.3.9.6.1. Con:
        If true, this only proves that evolution and religious creation accounts are mutually exclusive, not which option is true.

          1.3.9.6.1.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.

        1.3.9.6.2. Con:
        Evolution is not a theory of cosmology or of origins. It is a scientific explanation of natural history and the diversity of life. Therefore evolution does not necessarily contradict religious creation myths.

        1.3.9.6.3. Con:
        Even if evolution contradicts existing religions, it doesn’t follow that God  doesn’t exist.

        1.3.9.6.4. Con:
        -> See 1.3.9.2.1.2.3.

        1.3.9.6.5. Con:
        Evolution is a man made theory (emphasize on theory) that conflicts with one of the most basic law of physics, namely, 2nd Law of Thermodynamics and entropy. Therefore, our existence is NOT a consequence of evolution.

          1.3.9.6.5.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.

          1.3.9.6.5.2. Con:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.3.3.

          1.3.9.6.5.3. Con:
          The parent illustrates a lack of understanding of the 2nd law of thermodynamics. The law states that in a closed system entropy will always increase. The earth is not a closed system. This planet receives massive quantities of energy from the sun and so evolution does not in any way violate the second law as long as the net entropy of the universe as a whole increases which it does. Also the parent claim is deliberately misrepresenting what the word theory means in a scientific context.

        1.3.9.6.6. Con:
        It is possible for all religions to be false and for a God to still exist

          1.3.9.6.6.1. Con:
          Irrelevant. The thesis refers to a classical God.

    1.3.10. Pro:
    There are examples of poor design in the universe. God would not have created faulty designs. Therefore, God may not exist.

      1.3.10.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.7.1.1.2.1.2.

      1.3.10.2. Pro:
      Man’s products reflect his qualities, especially the qualities of his mind. Man if he is the product of God’s creation also reflects the qualities of God, especially the qualities of His mind. Since an imperfect, defective man could produce plenty of good quality products which reflect well on him, it’s unlikely that God had created an imperfect, defective man who reflects badly on Him. Thus God might not have created man & may not necessarily exist.

        1.3.10.2.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.

      1.3.10.3. Pro:
      A manufacturer would make corrections when his products are defective. Of course if God didn’t exist/didn’t create nature, rectifications of nature’s defects (back-up services) wouldn’t happen. Thus God may not exist.

        1.3.10.3.1. Con:
        If God has a perfect plan then any “defects” would be part of His plan

    1.3.11. Pro:
    No wise/intelligent creator would produce critical and rebellious beings. Therefore, an intelligent creator (i.e. God) must not exist.

      1.3.11.1. Pro:
      Man invented artificial intelligence, robots and automatons which follow his instructions blindly evidently without criticizing, blaming or going against him. A Creator would be foolish to create something (& give them free will) which are capable of going against or even harming Him. This may indicate nature/man is not the creation of God/God doesn't exist.

        1.3.11.1.1. Con:
        None can harm God for He is invincible.

        1.3.11.1.2. Con:
        We have plenty of examples of humans creating things that harm them. Like cigarettes. Why not God?

          1.3.11.1.2.1. Con:
          Cigarettes were invented years ago to bring pleasure,joy, possibly stress relief,even macho image. Their link to lung cancer hadn’t then been known yet–this link was discovered only much later resulting in many giving up smoking,though a no. continue to smoke despite being warned/knowing about the cancer risk.Cigarettes are evidently not conscious objects which willfully bring harm to those who smoke them, unlike man who are conscious beings who may willfully complain about or rebel against God.

      1.3.11.2. Pro:
      The more humans debate about the existence & qualities of God, the less likely is the possibility of humans’ creation by God(s). Artificial intelligence such as robots & automatons created by man never behave like that towards their creator.

    1.3.12. Pro:
    God might have existed before & might have stopped existing at some point in time.

      1.3.12.1. Pro:
      It’s often said that man is made in the image of God which is possible. If so, God would have at least some similar characteristics with man (e.g. intelligence, morals, mortality, etc.,). This means God could be mortal. If God were mortal, the following could be interesting possibilities: (a) God had passed on without an heir(s) (i.e.no God exists anymore). (b) God had passed on with heir(s) who are God(s) in their own right.

    1.3.13. Pro:
    Religions contain hypocrisy. God would construct a perfect religion if he existed. Therefore, God does not exist.

      1.3.13.1. Con:
      God may have a sufficient moral reason to allow or ordain hypocrisy

        1.3.13.1.1. Pro:
        It is possible that hypocrisy of religion is necessary to achieve God’s purposes for creation.

          1.3.13.1.1.1. Con:
          When your proposition is an infinitely powerful magical entity, all things are 'possible'. The claim of the possibility of an explanation -- like the claim of the possibility of 'morally sufficient reason' or 'divine pragmatism of hypocrisy' -- is entirely irrelevant. What is relevant is probable or demonstrable claims.
          It is possible God has created a universe that appears entirely natural, authored no books, and has hidden Itself. Such a claim has no epistemic value; it's unfalsifiable.

        1.3.13.1.2. Con:
        It also may be the case that we live in a universe that has no causality and one moment is completely random and unrelated to the previous one, and the appearance of causality is nothing more than an unlikely chain of moments...
        Proposing unsupported hypothetical cases doesn't actually get us anywhere.

      1.3.13.2. Con:
      Religions do contain hypocrisy. But religious hypocrisy is a product of the human organization of religion, and therefore a reflection of the fallen and sinful state of mankind rather than God's error.

        1.3.13.2.1. Con:
        If a human religion is imperfect and fallible, its claim that a perfect and infallible entity exists is itself imperfect and fallible.

      1.3.13.3. Pro:
      The central text of a religion can describe a God that is a hypocrite, not just its followers.

        1.3.13.3.1. Con:
        God of the Bible does not wish for these things to occur. See the book of Jonah [471]

        1.3.13.3.2. Con:
        Everyone was involved in race wars in that time period. God told them to partake in these wars in more ethical ways that show more respect for the humanity of those they fought.

        1.3.13.3.3. Pro:
        God is described as loving, and yet committed a genocide in a Global Flood. This action (genocide) contradictions the espoused value (loving) and is therefore hypocritical.

          1.3.13.3.3.1. Con:
          The Bible contains a flood narrative because every religion of the day had a flood narrative [472] not because it happened. The purpose of the flood narrative in the Bible is to show the difference between Yahweh and other gods. In the story of Utnapishtim, Utnapishtim [473]remembers the mercy shown him and Enlil is chastised. In the story of Noah, God remembers Noah [474], and God relinquishes his bow [475].

        1.3.13.3.4. Pro:
        God is described as loving, and yet ordered Moses to "utterly destroy" (Deut 20:17) "all the cities which are very far off from thee" (Deut 20:15). This call for indiscriminate war, and violent against everything "that breatheth" (Deut 20:16), undermines the value of love, and is therefore hypocritical.

          1.3.13.3.4.1. Con:
          Deuteronomy is likely allegorical rather than literal. Historical evidence shows that Deut. was written around the time of the exile. The people reading this book were people who were survivors from Babylonian destruction. Deut. 20 provides an explanation for their destruction (The people of Israel became exactly the same as the people around them).

          1.3.13.3.4.2. Con:
          The fact that it contradicts God's love is likely the point of Deut. 20. In Exodus 32 when destruction is promised, Moses tells God that if he is going to blot them out, blot him out instead, and God listens.
          
          The Israelites should have responded to God, that it was unmerciful for them to do this thing, destroy themselves instead. (I.e. the Israelites should have taken the role of Jesus, let me bear the consequences of their sin, not them.)

        1.3.13.3.5. Pro:
        God is described as loving, and yet calls on the soldiers of Israel to keep "all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him [476]" as the spoils of war. Keeping people as spoils of war violates the value of being loving, as such is hypocritical.

          1.3.13.3.5.1. Con:
          Even if God did give the command, the reason for taking the woman and children captive were to provide provision without which they would likely starve to death. Deuteronomy 21:10-14 details the process for marrying captive women and those who didn't marry would have become servants, but there were rules against mistreating them as well (Ex 21:26-27, Dt 23:15-16).  Further his is clear that both widow and orphan are to be cared for (Dt 10:18 says)
          
          Thus, God is demonstrating love.

            1.3.13.3.5.1.1. Pro:
            It is also important to understand that this all happens subsequent to Adam's insistence that man can run the planet without God. The simple 10 Commandments become a 'constitution' to MOSES' further legislation, not necessarily God's. This is also happening at a time when the population of Earth is much smaller, the planet less tame. When people see 'servants' exchanged on Vikings, Game of Thrones, Downton Abbey (assigned to other houses, etc.)  it somehow doesn't seem to raise this same ire.

        1.3.13.3.6. Con:
        God is not a hypocrite as he makes no pretense about who God is. He says how he will behave in Exodus 34:6-7 [477] and behaves exactly that way (see Deuteronomy 20).

      1.3.13.4. Con:
      God may be evil or incompetent or indifferent to human beliefs or a hypocrite.
      The content of a religious text only tells the character of the proposed God. Not liking that character is a poor excuse for abstaining from believing in It.

      1.3.13.5. Con:
      We cannot understand god enough to know that god would create a religion, nor that if god did create one that god could not have a reason to create an imperfect religion. Or several.

        1.3.13.5.1. Pro:
        The 'God would do it this way' claim is not a substantial argument for completely discounting the possibility of the existence. If God exists, how would we have the knowledge to decide what God does, is like or thinks about religions, imperfect or otherwise?

          1.3.13.5.1.1. Con:
          A model for evaluating a situation can be constructed from classical definitions of God, and then shown to be absurd when compared with data from reality. Imperfect religions are such a data point.

      1.3.13.6. Pro:
      It doesn't matter if God exists.  What matters is how people behave in his name, and in general they behave badly.  Even if He exists, He ought to be ignored and forgotten.

        1.3.13.6.1. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.4.2.

        1.3.13.6.2. Con:
        How one’s children behave doesn’t necessarily reflect on their upbringing by their parents. If God exists, his character isn’t necessarily affected or perfectly presented by his followers.

        1.3.13.6.3. Con:
        There are many atheists or secularists who have behaved just as badly. We shouldn’t ignore or not consider their beliefs because of this.

      1.3.13.7. Con:
      Hypocrisy is often subjective (Along with "Contradictions") which is explained away when a fuller understanding of the text, teaching, or otherwise is gained.

      1.3.13.8. Con:
      The construction of a perfect religion is a process. The God of the Bible is actively working on this exact task.

        1.3.13.8.1. Con:
        God being all powerful would not need to work on such a task. It would just be.

          1.3.13.8.1.1. Pro:
          It is not clear why God would have created anything, including the universe itself, let alone religion.

          1.3.13.8.1.2. Con:
          God is frequently conceived of as being outside of time.  Therefore, if at any point in the future a perfect religion exists, from the perspective of a God outside of time, that religion would "just be".

      1.3.13.9. Con:
      The problem that many people cannot seem to overcome, is they keep trying to put God in a Man-Sized-Box. People in general, even many self-professed Christians, just can't wrap their minds around the idea that there could be something greater than ourselves. We reason by saying, "Because this seems like the most logical conclusion TO ME, then God must capitulate.”

      1.3.13.10. Con:
      Christianity does not contain hypocrisy.  Human beings who call themselves "Christian" can be hypocrites, but the religion itself does not contain hypocrisy (i.e. God is not a hypocrite).

    1.3.14. Pro:
    The existence of people who don't believe in God is evidence against the existence of God.

      1.3.14.1. Pro:
      Drange's argument 
      1 God is omniscient.
      2 God is omnipotent.
      3 God wants everyone to believe in him.
      4 Since God is omniscient, he knows exactly what demonstration would convince any given person that he exists.
      5 Since God is omnipotent, he is capable of performing this demonstration.
      6 Since God wants everyone to believe in him, he wants to perform this demonstration.
      7 However, atheists manifestly exist.
      8 Therefore, the god described by the first three conditions does not exist.

        1.3.14.1.1. Con:
        Even if steps 1 through 5 could be proven to be accurate, step 6 is not necessarily true. There could be conditions involved beyond what God simply wants. For example, if God gave man free will, He finds it important. Proof of God's existence takes away some of man's choice. Also, if faith is important, proof of God's existence negates some of the need for faith.

          1.3.14.1.1.1. Con:
          If you don't believe and ask God for proof of his existence, you won't receive it. There is no problem with free will in this case.

            1.3.14.1.1.1.1. Con:
            It is possible that the requester has already been given adequate proof and is choosing to ignore it (suppress it) or has an incorrect idea of what warrants belief (or disbelief) in God. Therefore, we can not conclusively determine that God hasn’t given such an individual adequate evidence.

              1.3.14.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
              If we setup an experiment and avoid personal biases and compensate for random chance, God won't give us positive result for its existence.

                1.3.14.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The parent is an unwarranted assumption. However, even if true, there is no reason to expect that God would answer to humans under such circumstances. It could very well be that God, a free being, has good reasons to not respond to humans attempting to "measure" His existence. Arguing that God would do otherwise is an argument from omniscience.

                  1.3.14.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.

                  1.3.14.1.1.1.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                  God could not answer to humans at all and still exists.

              1.3.14.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
              The adequate proof should be adequate for the requester or objective observer.

                1.3.14.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                The proposition, “God should cater to personal epistemological demands from His creatures,” is far from apparent.

                  1.3.14.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Pro:
                  -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.

                  1.3.14.1.1.1.1.2.1.2. Con:
                  If we want to show something to a blind person, it's good not to use visual-only communication.

                1.3.14.1.1.1.1.2.2. Pro:
                Anyone can assign to God anything, if we don't require strong proof. (And there is nothing, that has to be assign to him).

          1.3.14.1.1.2. Con:
          Faith would be most important, if God was an fictional creature. In that case, it is necessary. (There could be no proof.)

            1.3.14.1.1.2.1. Pro:
            Faith is a defective epistemology. Theism ultimately rests on Faith which is choosing to be more confident in certain propositions than warranted by evidence [478] alone.

              1.3.14.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
              Not all forms of theism define faith as “blind” or some unwarranted assertion. The Christian view of “faith,” includes the use of reason and logic. Christ’s representatives are commanded by scripture to use their minds to discern truth (Matthew 22:37, 2 Timothy 3:16, 1 Timothy 4:13, 15-16, Ephesians 5:15-17). Christian faith includes an intellectual pursuit of who God is, the world He created, and the reasons for our faith (1 Peter 3:15). Reason and logic are necessary to accomplish this task.

                1.3.14.1.1.2.1.1.1. Pro:
                Faith is denoted as simply trusting in something or someone, or accepting something without proof.  It's not inherently theistic in nature.  Anyone choosing to accept something as factual without any actual evidence (such as the theory that the universe and life are evolving) is exercising faith.

                  1.3.14.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Equivocation. Faith as belief in or trust in someone or something is distinct from Faith as an epistemology, i.e. choosing to be more confident in certain propositions than warranted by evidence alone.

                    Faith is essentially a universally human quality [479].  The parent is simply applying it differently. (See section 11 above)

              1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2. Con:
              As no one can know any worldview is true with 100% certainty, all worldviews are ultimately chosen on some measure of faith. The measure of individual certainty could be 90%, 70%, or even 51% depending on the epistomological methods of the believer. However, the amount of certainty does not change the reality that all worldviews must be taken as true on some measure of faith to fill the remaining gap. Facing this gap and accepting the worldview as true is what theists typically mean by “faith.”

                1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.1. Con:
                Equivocation. Nothing learned through induction is 100% certain, but acting on one's best guess does not require religious faith, i.e. even if you are no more confident than warranted by evidence alone, you can still act.

                  1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  The parent again redefines religious faith. It is no different than an atheist’s choice to put their confidence in atheism as the true worldview.

                    1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                    Atheist can be turned by proved God's action. Believer don't left faith, if no proved God's action is done. If someone see some thing as God's action and other don't, then it's not really proof. It's biased.

                1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2. Con:
                It is reasonable to act based on the most likely Truth, and not the second most likely, third most likely and so on. God and religion are among the less likely truths (according to overwhelming evidence).

                  1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2.1. Con:
                  What one finds as “most likely” depends on what one considers to establish warrant. Obviously it is far from apparent to billions of people that the evidence against God’s existence is “overwhelming.”

                    1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1. Pro:
                    When one considers examples like that of Lee Strobel [480] who was an avid atheist before he reviewed the evidence for Christianity, it was the evidence itself that changed his mind that Christianity was true and God did exist.

                      1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      For every anecdote of atheists converting to theism because of evidence, there is more than one anecdote of theists becoming atheists because of evidence. Anecdotes may suffice as counterexamples to a universal, but otherwise are not good arguments.

                        1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        If the evidence against God was so “overwhelming” as claimed, then we should expect to see no reasonable person believe in God. Yet many of the world’s greatest minds believe in God.

                          There is a positive correlation between atheism and IQ. The most reasonable people are the most likely to be atheist, despite considerable social pressure from the majority theists.

                            The parent confuses correlation with causation. Just because intelligent people are more likely to not be religious could be a result of any number of factors besides intelligence. Since there are incredibly intelligent theists, this is far more likely.

                              The real cause of the correlation is that people with greater rationality (i.e. critical thinking) are more likely to be atheist. This is correlated with intelligence, but it's not the same thing [481]. Without rationality, intelligence can be used to defeat itself [482].

                                The parent confuses correlation with causation. Just because rational people are more likely to not be religious could be a result of any number of factors besides their epistemological methods. Since there are incredibly rational theists, this is far more likely.

                                  In short - you will be having greater problem with impossible or illogical things, if you are more inteligent. But you still can believe them otherwise. Just for more intelligent people is harder to overcome it.

                          The vast majority of theists are not exposed to debates that might present such evidence. So they might be reasonable, but not well informed in this particular area.

                        1.3.14.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.1.1.2. Pro:
                        Atheists are growing as a demographic, and not primarily through child-bearing. Thus theists must be becoming atheist at a greater rate than atheists become theists.

                      When one considers the hundreds of religious leaders in The Clergy Project [484], we note that those who have studied their religion the most still become atheists. They studied the doctrine thoroughly and finally concluded it is nonsense.

              1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3. Con:
              The statement, “theism ultimately rests on faith” presupposes that God hasn’t revealed Himself to the world in any meaningful way, that all evidences presented for God’s existence are false, and that the experiences of billions of people who testify to knowing God are completely false. Thus the parent is an unwarranted claim.

                1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3.1. Con:
                Argumentum ad populum [486]. Historically, the majority of living adults have believed false things, like geocentrism. This did not prove geocentrism true.

                  1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  It’s true that popularity doesn’t prove truth.  The previous claim was refuted on the basis that equating theism to belief in unicorns/dragons as figments of human imagination is a category error. Theology finds its basis in revelation and various observations about the universe. A figment of imagination is by definition a very different thing (also different than geocentrism, which was man’s conclusion based on observation at the time).

                    1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3.1.1.1. Con:
                    Unicorns and dragons also have basis in reality (rhinos and large reptiles), but the mythical versions are confused imaginary derivatives of the originals. Likewise, all mythical god beliefs had real historical causes, but are imaginary confusions. Myth is myth. It's the same category.

                  1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3.1.2. Con:
                  It is not an argument ad populum to point to billions of points of data. The grandparent is not claiming that because the MAJORITY of people believe in God, He exists. It is saying that we can’t arbitrarily ignore or dismiss these billions of personal experiences.

              Any argument is invalid which asserts 'faith' as an 'epistemology' as well as arguments that inject religious connotations, (such as 'blind faith'), because all of these assertions rely on anachronistic definitions and do not properly convey the 'plain meaning' of the term of 'trust' as seen through 'historical criticism', (how the term was originally used colloquially).

          1.3.14.1.1.3. Pro:
          Perhaps God wants his followers to perform the demonstration rather than perform it Himself. Step 6 definitely has other possibilities.

        1.3.14.1.2. Con:
        God does not want to convince all human beings through His power to believe in Him because if He does, some people won't believe because they don't want to in the first place. The ones who really want to believe would seek Him.

          1.3.14.1.2.2. Con:
          Awareness is involuntary [502]. If the evidence is apparent and sufficient, even those who don't want to believe will believe. At worst they could lie about it.

        -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.

        1.3.14.1.5. Con:
        Since (3) and (6) claim to know what God wants, this is either an argument from omniscience or affirmation that God exists. Without some sort of special revelation from God, one would have to be omniscient to know what God would want to do in any set of circumstances. Perhaps Drange recieved some special revelation from God to support (3) and (6). If this is the case, God exists.

          1.3.14.1.5.1. Con:
          The major theistic religions do make claim (3) and the argument only purports to disprove the God described by 1-3. Redefining "God" as something other than that worshiped by theists and explicitly defined in the argument is equivocation/moving the goalposts.

            1.3.14.1.5.1.1. Con:
            -> See 1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.3.1.

        1.3.14.1.6. Con:
        Drange's arguments doesn’t prove that God's existence is impossible. It just proves that God, if he exists, doesn’t want everyone to believe in him. Starting from this point there are 2 possibilities:
        1) God doesn’t exist.
        2) God exists, as some people believe (an omniscient and omnipresent God), but God doesn’t want everyone to believe him.
        The hypothesis of a God who doesn’t want everyone to believe in him is easy to sustain. eg.: if our life is just a kind of test.

          1.3.14.1.6.1. Con:
          There are other possible conclusions such as “God exists but has possible reasons for the level of revelation provided.”

        1.3.14.1.7. Con:
        God doesn't need to prove His existence. He will indeed reveal Himself to those He, in  His omnipotent wisdom, chooses to reveal Himself to. God is not constrained by the demands of mere humans to prove His existence. You believe because you have faith, and faith is given by God.

          1.3.14.1.7.1. Con:
          -> See 1.3.14.1.1.2.1.

          1.3.14.1.7.2. Con:
          The Great Demon doesn't need to prove His existence. He will indeed reveal Himself to those He, in His omnipotent wisdom, chooses to reveal Himself to. The Great Demon is not constrained by the demands of mere humans to prove His existence. You believe because you have faith, and faith is given by The Great Demon.
          
          Any standard of epistemology lax enough to permit this type of argument, works on anything. The Flying Spaghetti Monster. The Magic Sandwich. Whatever.

          1.3.14.1.7.3. Con:
          Yes, God does not need to prove His existence, but it's for a different reason. God has indeed already revealed himself to all of us: since "God is Love" (1 John 4:8), God is present where love is shown. For this reason, God does not need to reveal Himself to us, as we unknowingly reveal and experience Him everyday. One believes when one knows the presence of God through love. Therefore, faith is not a God-given gift, but rather, an accessible perspective of life; a knowledge of God between us.

        1.3.14.1.8. Con:
        Premise 3 is false. God does not actively need everyone to believe in Him, but rather, He wants that every person goes to Heaven to live the fullness of life with Him, and the truth is that you do not NEED to know God to enter heaven, you just need to be good (Matthew 5:48 - Sermon on the Mount: teachings on how to enter Heaven).

      1.3.14.2. Pro:
      Shellenberg's argument
      1 If God existed, there would be no instances of reasonable or inculpable non-belief.
      2 But there are instances of reasonable or inculpable non-belief.
      3 Therefore, God does not exist.

        1.3.14.2.2. Con:
        God could make His existence more obvious. However, he may have good reasons [503] for not doing so.

          1.3.14.2.2.1. Pro:
          "A god would make itself more obvious if it existed," is an unwarranted assumption. Since we can't know everything, it is unwarranted to ascribe any action or motivation to God beyond those actions that He has revealed (assuming general and special revelation has occurred). To do so would be an argument from omniscience.

          1.3.14.2.2.2. Pro:
          It could be that God isn't all that interested in ensuring that everyone knows beyond doubt that He exists, because He may have other motivations. For example, Christians believe that God's purpose for humanity is to share in a loving relationship with Himself for all of eternity. It could be that God, in His wisdom and providence, knows that ensuring everyone believes He exists would do nothing to accomplish this goal. In fact, it could possibly have the opposite effect. We can't know.

        1.3.14.2.4. Con:
        Shellenberg's argument's first point ought to give evidence. He is putting forth a claim.
        
        What compels us to conclude that God's existence equates to "no instances of reasonable or inculpable non-belief?"

        1.3.14.2.5. Con:
        #1 is not true. It's possible to have instances of reasonable non-belief in things that do exist.

      1.3.14.3. Pro:
      Jean-Paul Sartre [504] is known for his saying: ' The human is condemned to be free'. Which means that if a human desires to not use his freedom of reasoning, he still uses his own freedom to make that decision. If God exists, human beings would have the freedom to choose whether they believe in it or not. Please see argument in the Pros.

        1.3.14.3.1. Pro:
        1. If a human being is condemned to be free, he will choose whether God exists or not

          1.3.14.3.1.1. Pro:
          2. A human being is condemned to be free and chooses whether God exists or not

          1.3.14.3.1.2. Pro:
          3. Human beings have the freedom to choose therefore God is in a superposition state.

          1.3.14.3.1.3. Pro:
          4.Saying with certainty that God exists, means that every human being has chosen that God exists.

          1.3.14.3.1.4. Pro:
          5. As there are not only religious people on the planet, but also atheists, God can not be in a certainty state of existence.

        1.3.14.3.2. Con:
        This confuses a question of metaphysical reality with an epistemological belief. In a metaphysical sense, God either exists or he doesn't. This would be true regardless of human opinion about the matter.

    1.3.15. Pro:
    God and evil are incompatible. Evil exists. Therefore, God does not exist.

      1.3.15.1. Con:

      1.3.15.2. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.4.2.8.2.

      1.3.15.3. Pro:
      1. God is all good.
      2. God created everything.
      3. An all good being wouldn’t create the feeling of bad.
      4. The feeling of bad exists.
      5. Therefore, God as defined by 1 and 2 doesn't exist.

        1.3.15.3.1. Con:
        (3) is an argument from omniscience because it claims to know that an all good God would not permit feelings of badness.  An all good God might have very good reasons for allowing feelings a badness. The burden of proof lies on the one making the claim that a good God would not allow evil.

          1.3.15.3.1.1. Con:
          (3) is the definition of all-good.

            1.3.15.3.1.1.1. Con:
            Saying that God as the maximally great being is good does not necessarily entail the complete and total prohibition of evil done by created free-agents. The burden of proof for demonstrating why God's goodness would entail no evil rests on the shoulders of the one making that claim.

              1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
              'God created everything' means God created everything: including things and feelings that free creatures can create.

                1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                This implies that God is accountable for the actions of His free creatures. This is far from apparent. How could God be accountable for the free actions of a creature? If He was, the creature is not really free for all his actions are ultimately God's. One would have to prove that the creatures actions were not really free.

                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  Under the premise God created the framework in which beings can act, eg. God created the possibility of doing bad.

                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                  If a parent knew every action their child would ever take and still decides to have them then they should be held accountable for the actions since they knew they would occur ahead of time.

                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.1.3. Pro:
                  God could have avoided creating free creatures altogether; however, that is primarily a value judgement. If God determines it is a greater good to create free creatures that could go right or wrong, that is a judgement He is able to make.

                1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2. Con:
                No reason has been given for why God would not allow for feelings of badness to originate in free creatures. The burden of proof is on the one making the claim.

                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  Bad is defined as the opposite of good. An all-good being is defined as a being that maximizes good. An all-good being wouldn't allow for feelings of bad, because feelings of bad are not good but the opposite of good (bad). Without feelings of bad, the total amount of good would be higher in the world. Therefore, an all-good being would not create the feelings of bad.

                    1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    It is possible that God defines a person's self-defined feelings of bad as good. Therefore, there would be no problem unless there is some objective standard of good to which one appeals. No objective standard, no problem.

                      1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                      Such a god would not be an all good god by definition. Such a god would be a god and if such a god was called all good then the only thing good would mean would be godly which is not what is meant in this thread.

                        1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        Such a god would not be an all good god as determined and defined by an arbitrarily chosen, subjective, shifting, changeable standard of individual morality. This standard isn’t worth paying any attention to at all because it cannot be labelled objectively right or wrong. It is a useless foundation for accusing a god of causing bad feelings.

                          1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          A standard that is objective is not the only type of standard worth considering. If in discourse a subjective standard is commonly used and understood than either the standard should be used or the question being debated should be deemed incoherent and nonsensical.

                            1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                            If the parent is the case, then I personally define a good God to be one that can allow bad feelings in people. Thus, the original argument is no longer an objection to God’s existence.

                              1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                              You personally may label whatever you want as good or as bad but changing the definitions of the labels themselves renders the language useless. Good is a label for pleasant experiences and things and bad is a label for the reverse. If a being is said to be all good it can be inferred to maximize the labeling of things as good and thus not allowing the labeling of things as bad. In effect the parent seeks to label the label bad as good which is a contradiction of definitions.

                                1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                Good is an adjective that can be used for more than feelings or experiences. It is used to label particular concepts like love, justice, peace between people, strength, honor, and courage (all nouns) as things to be desired or approved. Thus making good only about pleasure is inappropriately narrow.

                                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                  It does not need to be narrowed in such a way for the sake of argument. Those nouns are still being labeled and in a world that maximizes good things then no one would need to be exposed to any noun that they would label as bad.

                                    1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                    It is entirely impossible to prove that "no one would need to be exposed to any noun that they would label as bad," necessarily. This is simply an unwarranted conclusion. There are many possible reasons why it may be worth it for people to be exposed to "bad" things to achieve a greater "good" (such as the atonement). If it is even possible, that this is the case, then the argument fails.

                                      1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                                      God cannot do the logically impossible.  If God’s objective was to create a world with free creatures that share a loving relationship with him then he had to allow for the possibility that they would go wrong.  This is one possible reason why God would allow for evil.

                                        1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                                        An omnipotent God  can do the logically impossible and force people into a loving relationship.

                                          If God as omnipotent can do the logically impossible, then the problem of evil collapses.  Purpose of the argument is to demonstrate that God is an incoherent concept. If one insists that God can be an incoherent concept then the entire problem evaporates.

                                        That some evil is human-caused is insufficient to excuse natural evils, like plagues and earthquakes.

                                        Human decision making is already constrained by our biology and our brain structure our subconscious influences us in ways we cannot perceive. Therefore we are already not 100% completely free and god could just tweak us to be a little bit less so and we would still be "free" creatures entering a relationship with him freely while at the same time not being able to commit atrocities like mass murder.

                                      If the being creating the world is truly all powerful and their goal is actually to maximize good things then it is impossible that the resulting world would contain bad things at all since they could create a world in which bad things do not exist and only good ones do exist. If that is not the goal or if the being is not all powerful then it is possible but under those two stipulations it is not.

                                      Under the Christian worldview, God is concerned with establishing relationships with free creatures, which may be best accomplished by allowing evil in the world.

                          Such a god would not be all good using the common definition of the word. Something must be meant by all good in order to discuss it. Otherwise we can simply throw out the concept of all good god and discuss god without it which is fine. The original claim at the top of the thread only objects to an all good god. The point has been made that an all good god using the common understanding of the term is not possible given the world we live in.

                            1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1. Pro:
                            "Something must be meant by all good in order to discuss it." This is exactly the point. An objective definition of what is good is required to even have this discussion.

                              1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                              A definition being required to discuss something does not mean an objective definition is required. There is no objective definition of tall yet we may discuss whether someone or something is tall in comparison to other things. When no objective definition exists a subjective one will do just fine.

                1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.3. Pro:

                1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4. Con:

                2.	God foreknows I will do X. 
                3.	Therefore, necessarily I will do X.
                
                This commits a fallacy in modal logic. All that follows from the two premises is that one will do X [505]. Not that you will necessarily do X. You could refrain. If you were to refrain, God’s foreknowledge would have been different.

                  1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4.1. Con:

                  2. (The converse) God foreknows I will do x if and only if I will do x.
                  3. Therefore if God foreknows I will do x it is not possible for me to not do x.
                  4. Thus by duality of modal logic If god foreknows I will do x it is necessary that I do x.
                  Foreknowledge is before the event in question. The existence of this knowledge implies the existence of a direct causal link of events otherwise such knowledge would be impossible.

                    1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4.1.1. Con:
                    An event X must cause foreknowledge* for there is no foreknowledge without X. 
                    
                    *foreknowledge is knowledge of what will happen in the actual world.

                      1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1. Con:
                      Complete foreknowledge is neither caused nor causes. Foreknowledge simply implies the availability of information with which one can construct a direct causal chain from genesis onward. The existence of said information, the possibility of making such a link implies determinism.

                        1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                        If complete foreknowledge is neither caused nor causes then there is no problem. Without a causal relationship, free will is preserved.

                          1.3.15.3.1.1.1.1.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                          The parent simply ignores everything said in the grandparent after the first sentence. The grandparent clearly states where the causal part comes into effect if one reads the whole claim.

        1.3.15.3.2. Con:
        The feeling of bad is an incoherent concept without some standard of good to depart from. There is no standard that grounds “the good” apart from God. Thus, if God doesn’t exist, then the feeling of “badness” doesn’t exist. It is just some illusion. It isn’t objectively real. Therefore, this argument fails. It depends on God’s existence to succeed.

          1.3.15.3.2.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.4.

          1.3.15.3.2.2. Con:
          The feeling of 'badness' exists, even if it is an illusion. It is real in the sense that we feel it.

            1.3.15.3.2.2.1. Con:
            If the feeling of badness is an illusion, then there is no problem because we aren’t really feeling it.

            1.3.15.3.2.2.2. Con:
            The feeling of badness can’t both exist in a metaphysical sense and be an illusion. This is incoherent.

              1.3.15.3.2.2.2.1. Con:
              The feeling of badness unquestionably exists as a subjective feeling. Things can be illusions objectively, but subjective experience is always real.

          1.3.15.3.2.3. Con:
          The feeling of bad is determined by one's experiences and is defined in reference to good just as good is defined in reference to bad there need not be an objective standard. It is a relative dichotomy.  They are recursive feelings that find their origin in how our nervous system is naturally averted to and drawn to certain stimuli.

            1.3.15.3.2.3.1. Con:
            On this view the feeling of badness is arbitrarily determined and therefore we can’t conclude it is bad. We can’t know which arbitrary definition is correct. We can’t know the feeling of badness isn’t actually a feeling of goodness misunderstood as badness.

              1.3.15.3.2.3.1.1. Con:
              There is no arbitrariness in feeling bad. We can obviously conclude that not feeling bad is better than feeling bad. Going deep into philosophy is not needed whatsoever.

                1.3.15.3.2.3.1.1.1. Con:
                This conclusion is not obvious at all. It is arbitrarily chosen that a certain feeling is bad. This means if someone defines what would normally be considered pleasure as “bad” they can’t be wrong. Or say a sociopath defines what is normally considered bad as good. The sociopath then spreads these “good feelings.” We can’t say the sociopath is wrong. Thus the arbitrariness matters. If feeling bad has no definition, then how can we say there are bad feelings? Those bad feelings could be good.

                  1.3.15.3.2.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The definition of the adjective "Good" is "to be desired or approved of." What each individual desires and approves of is different  as is what they are averted to and disapprove of. Approval and disapproval are typically associated with pleasant and unpleasant feelings respectively. The shared understanding of pleasant and unpleasant feelings is how we understand and communicate about the concepts of good and bad and thus there are no correct answers and no need to go deeper than feelings.

              1.3.15.3.2.3.1.2. Con:
              On the view of the grandparent there is no correct definition since they are all relative and subjective. Each individual has their own experience of good and bad and people understand the terms through the lens of pleasant feelings and unpleasant feelings. Just because the concept is subjective does not mean it is incoherent.

              1.3.15.3.2.3.1.3. Con:
              In that case we would be inhenrently morally evil, and thus not created by a classical God.

        1.3.15.3.3. Con:
        (2) assumes there are no free creatures that could freely create good and bad things/feelings. This is far from apparent. At most we can say God allows or concurs with the existence of feelings of badness. He doesn’t have to create them.

          1.3.15.3.3.1. Con:

        1.3.15.3.4. Con:
        How can good be identified and defined if there is no evil. God did not create evil, God permitted evil to exist in order to prove the existence of good, which is one of His many unlimited attributes.

          1.3.15.3.4.1. Con:
          Good can be and actually is defined [506] as something pleasant or favorable or agreeable etc. IE something that is desired. All that is required for this is volition the ability to want or desire some experience is all that is necessary for our current definition of good to be usable.

            1.3.15.3.4.1.1. Con:
            This is turns "good" into an individual's linguistic utterances. If good is not objective, this language used to describe "something pleasant or favorable" is illusory. It isn't real.

              1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1. Con:
              Claiming to know the objectivity of something (for example claiming that objective moral values and duties exist) is an argument from omniscience.

                1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
                The parent makes our ability to know anything at all an "argument from omniscience."

                  1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.1.1. Con:
                  The parent claim does that. That is not a weakness of the parent claim.

                1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.2. Con:
                "Claiming to know the objectivity of something is an argument from omniscience" itself is a statement that is presented as objectively true. This statement defeats itself. If it is not objectively true, then why pay attention to it?

                  1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.2.1. Con:
                  We don't know whether anything is objectively true or not, as that would require omniscience. Knowing the truth value of the previous sentence also requaires omniscience. That is just how it is. The best we can do is use Occam's razor to order our claims from most plausible to least. The grandparent is high up there among the most plausible things.

                    1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                    "The best we can do is use Occam's razor to order our claims from most plausible to least. The grandparent is high up there among the most plausible things." This is a claim put forward as objective truth. But if we can't know anything as objectively true or not, then we also cannot know this.

                      1.3.15.3.4.1.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:

                      That is correct. We can use Occam's razor to order claims in plausibility, including the grandparent claim.

              1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2. Con:
              We don't know whether anything is objectively real or not (we would need omniscience to know that). The only thing we know for sure are our thoughts and feelings. These are subjectively real.

                1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2.1. Con:
                If "we don't know whether anything is objectively real" then we can't conclude our "thoughts and feelings" are objectively real. Therefore, the parent is self-defeating.

                  1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2.1.1. Con:
                  We can't conclude our thoughts and feelings are objectively real (whatever that would mean). Nevertheless, they are subjectively real.

                    1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1. Con:
                    If we can't conclude our thoughts are objectively real, then the thought, "our thoughts and feelings are subjectively real" is not objective truth. Therefore, the parent defeats itself.

                      1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.1. Pro:
                      We want objective and subjective to be defined as mutually exclusive.

                      1.3.15.3.4.1.1.2.1.1.1.2. Con:
                      It doesn't defeat itself. It just makes the thought subjective, not false.

              1.3.15.3.4.1.1.3. Con:
              Experiences can be illusory such as hallucinations but feelings are simply reactions to experiences be they illusory or real. As such it makes no sense to say the feeling of pleasantness is illusory.

                1.3.15.3.4.1.1.3.1. Con:
                The dispute is not over the "feeling" itself. Rather it is over the labeling of that feeling as "bad" or "good."  If there are no objective values and duties, then there is no reason to label the feeling "bad." The "badness" is what is illusory.

                  1.3.15.3.4.1.1.3.1.1. Con:
                  The words have definitions. As such each individual may label what they feel as good and as bad and everyone else who speaks English will understand that they mean that they find said experience or thing unpleasant objectiveness is unnecessary for the labeling of things and experiences. If terms needed to be objective we could never call anyone tall or small or smart or stupid or skinny or talented. Most of language would be obsolete and unusable.

          1.3.15.3.4.2. Pro:
          Good cannot be identified if there is no evil (bad). In the real world, good can be identified, therefore evil (or bad) exists.

        1.3.15.3.5. Con:
        Feelings of bad are inseparable from feelings of good. Humans cannot experience only one of them without the other.

          1.3.15.3.5.1. Con:
          Buddhists who have attained enlightenment claim to do just that. E.g. they still feel pain as a signal, but it no longer hurts.

      1.3.15.4. Pro:
      Since evil exists in the world, any supernatural entity that exists must be either less than all-powerful, or less than all-good. In either case, such a being is not God. Therefore there is no God.

        1.3.15.4.1. Con:
        An omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent God may have sufficient moral justification for temporarily allowing evil to obtain.

          1.3.15.4.1.1. Con:
          How can a moral and omnipotent being be so limited as to only have paths that include deep suffering to get to an ultimate Good? That seems to violate the idea of God's omnipotence, morality (and moral knowledge) or omniscience. At least one of those pillars would have to fall.

            1.3.15.4.1.1.1. Con:
            We also do not know how much greater evil and suffering would be without God intervening it. It’s possible it could be much worse.

              1.3.15.4.1.1.1.1. Con:
              If God is unable to completely eradicate all suffering, with the premise of him being all-good withstanding, then he would not be all powerful and therefore, not God.
              
              As an answer to the possible negation of this by the argument 'God may have reasons to do this which we cannot understand', then the question is of the point of discussing an incomprehensible being that may or may not exist, and which we have no way of learning about - being that we cannot understand its actions.

            1.3.15.4.1.1.2. Con:
            The assumption that ALL suffering is evil is an argument from omnipotence. There are clear examples where suffering leads to the accomplishment of a greater goal or outcome (e.g. physical therapy, discipline (such as in a boot camp), etc.)

            1.3.15.4.1.1.3. Con:
            This must be the best of all possible worlds [507].

            1.3.15.4.1.1.4. Con:
            The assumption that "ultimate suffering" is inherently evil presumes omniscience from the person defining what is and isn't evil as well as all potential future outcomes.  Because suffering exists, does not preclude that suffering is inherently evil.

              1.3.15.4.1.1.4.1. Con:
              If defining good and evil requires omniscience, then we would be unable to recognise God as being good, or at least attribute this quality to him. 'Good' would lose all meaning and therefore the proposition 'God is all-good' becomes nonsensical.

            1.3.15.4.1.1.5. Con:
            An all powerful God creating a system allowing free will would allow humans to bring either suffering into the world or love.  The beauty of love is only realized in a system of freewill.  
            
            Consequently, suffering can simply be the outcome of a system allowing for free will for greater purposes.

              1.3.15.4.1.1.5.1. Con:
              Why would God place restrictions on our ability to feel love? If God truly is omnipotent, he should be able to create a system allows love and restrains suffering, without the need for free will.

                1.3.15.4.1.1.5.1.1. Con:
                Love without free will is not love. It would be divine rape.

              1.3.15.4.1.1.5.2. Con:
              This is not true if God is omnipotent and ultimate good, unless free will is already a concept in which God has to operate. If so God must be in another god's creation.

                1.3.15.4.1.1.5.2.1. Con:
                Simply saying something is untrue isn't a grounds for dismissal. No evidence for or against has been presented in this rebuttal. Simply reasserting that God can't be good and be omnipotent/allowing suffering is just a reassertion of what is prior refuted.

          1.3.15.4.1.2. Con:
          Even if we grant this, the level of evil observed is egregious. It seems likely that God could accomplish His purposes with much less evil than this. Further excuses sound awfully ad-hoc.

            1.3.15.4.1.2.2. Con:
            To conclude the level of evil in the world is egregious requires omniscience. If Christianity is true, God will one day do away with evil and make the world  perfect for all eternity. Compared to the infinite good of eternity, temporary suffering is minuscule.

              1.3.15.4.1.2.2.1. Con:
              No, it requires a single counterexample, of which we have many. The amount of good is irrelevant to the question of the amount of evil.

                1.3.15.4.1.2.2.1.1. Con:
                The amount of good is deeply related if we are to understand the amount of evil is justified. This is further justified if the level of evil was a part of attaining the good.

            1.3.15.4.1.2.3. Con:
            Evil is only evil relative to good. Good is enormous therefore, the evil we experience is not really that egregious.

              The answer to "is there more good than evil in the world" depends on who you ask it is not a definitive thing since there is no metric on which to evaluate it.

                1.3.15.4.1.2.3.2.1. Con:

          1.3.15.4.1.3. Pro:
          When one experiences evil, they often question why God doesn't do away with it or why He allowed it in the first place. However, what one comes to realize is that if God were to do away with evil (destroy it) that would include all those who do evil. Assuming humans have creaturly freedom and that humans break God's divine commands and thus commit evil, God would have to do away with the entire human race. Therefore, those who wish to see evil eradicated, wish to see themselves eradicated.

        1.3.15.4.2. Con:
        The burden of proof in relation to the parent is on the one trying to prove that God and evil cannot possibly coexist. One must demonstrate that God could not for any reason have a justifiable reason for allowing the amount of evil we observe in the universe. This is a burden of proof that is impossible to bear for one would have to be omniscient to bear it.

            1.3.15.4.2.1.1. Pro:
            Consider a bumblebee stinging a person and dying. There is no reason for this. It brings pain to everyone invlolved. It the bumblebee needed to die it could just be killed naturally by an omnipotent god, or its death could be used to cause some positive such as giving a bird a meal.

              1.3.15.4.2.1.1.1. Con:
              This proves the point that omnipotence is required because there are any number of reasons that could be generated for t his hypothetical scenario. For example, the bee sting may have cause a delay of time in the life of the person stung that ultimately saved their life from a reckless driver texting just ahead of where the stinger was walking. Or perhaps the sting was necessary to find some other bump on the skin that turned out to be stage one skin cancer, thus saving the stingees life.

              1.3.15.4.2.1.1.2. Con:
              Perhaps the human and bee are two creatures acting exactly as they were designed to act and there was no reason for this particular instance. Yet, the event occurred within a world in which these types of minute evils were necessary to occur to bring about a larger purpose. We shouldn’t conclude that just because we can find one minute pointless evil, that God is not good for allowing it.

            1.3.15.4.2.1.2. Con:
            For every individual example provided, there is likely a possible defense available in which a good God and suffering can both exist.

          1.3.15.4.2.2. Con:
          Surely, by this logic, any knowledge of God requires omniscience, which no person has. In which case the burden of proof is on the party prescribing attributes to a creature that is unknowable without omniscience.

            1.3.15.4.2.2.1. Con:

        We need God for the world to work without evil. But world with evil works even without God.
        
        So existence of evil doesn't contradicts God, but make Him unnecessary.

        1.3.15.4.5. Con:
        Without God there is no basis for good and evil. If God does not exist then there is no evil.  If evil does not exist than this argument collapses. Since evil doesn’t exist, it cannot be used as evidence against God.

          1.3.15.4.5.1. Pro:
          “The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at the bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil and no other good. Nothing but blind, pitiless indifference. DNA neither knows nor cares. DNA just is. And we dance to its music.” Richard Dawkins

            1.3.15.4.5.1.1. Con:
            Dawkins specified "at the bottom", which allows for the possibility of purpose, evil, and good being non-fundamental, emergent properties.

        1.3.15.4.6. Pro:
        If god is the all loving person that Christians seem him to be then why does evil exist in the form of hurricanes, tsunamis and earthquakes. there is no logical explanation why god would want to kill thousands of innocent people? Some may say that he wishes the to be with hi in heaven but there seems to be no reason why he would want all of these people from the same area to all come to heaven at the same time.

          1.3.15.4.6.1. Con:
          False assumption of evil. Natural occurrences are the result of the physics of a universe in motion. Death is a result of the physics of a finite experience known as humanity. None of this is "evil."

        1.3.15.4.7. Con:
        It is possible to be benevolent and still allow the existence of some evil if it's necessary for a greater good.

        1.3.15.4.8. Con:
        The theodicy problem pre-supposes that one's human conception of good and evil is an accurate interpretation of reality.

          1.3.15.4.8.1. Con:
          Human's ability to conceive (at least reasonably well) between Good and Evil is necessary for distinguishing the Devil from God.

    1.3.16. Pro:
    A being can only be considered greater than another on the basis of Will, rather than power. All humans have Free Will, and no higher sort of Will exists. Therefore, there is no God.

      1.3.16.1. Con:
      This argument is fallacious. It assumes what it is trying to prove.

      1.3.16.2. Con:
      Greatness is not determined by how much will one has.

      1.3.16.3. Con:
      Human free will is limited by our ability to control ourselves, and we clearly fail to be the selves we want to be oftentimes. God's will is greater because he is always who he wants to be, and never disappoints himself.
      
      St. Augustine discusses this exact topic in his work, "The City of God."

      1.3.16.4. Con:
      You cannot make an assumptive statement like "no higher form of will exists", and expect to maintain rational dialogue. Do YOU have PROOF that no higher will exists? The fact is, God cannot be proven nor disproven.He exists because we believe in Him, and we believe in Him because He exists. Faith is the key to wisdom here...

  1.4. Con:
  Belief in God is irrational and unwarranted.

    1.4.1. Pro:

    1.4.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.3.14.1.1.2.1.

    1.4.3. Pro:
    To believe in a creator one must make far more assumptions than a non-believer. 
    A believer must assume:
    1. That non-physical beings are possible.
    2. That a non-physical being exists.
    3. That the being can interact with and create a physical reality.
    A non-believer must assume:
    1. The universe can be uncaused or was caused by something explainable by science.
    Therefore, non-belief is more justified with the current information and evidence we possess.

    1.4.4. Pro:
    God is a figment of human imagination.

      1.4.4.1. Pro:
      God is a consequence of the human desire for power, when individuals with conflicting desires form groups. The group assigns an individual with infinite power representing their shared goals in an attempt to dominate all others.

        1.4.4.1.1. Pro:
        Nietzsche argues in The Genealogy of Morality [509] that the origin of Christian values is a rebellion of the oppressed against their oppressors by asserting power and value to their own way of life as slaves. An example that shows this is the statement "the meek shall inherit the earth". To further own this state of slavery a new master created in God, removed power from their real-life oppressors and then asserted that this new master also had power over them as well. Here [510] is a good explanation.

        1.4.4.1.2. Pro:
        As Freud points out in The Future of an Illusion [511] (p9-10) this relationship to reality in the face of individual powerlessness is not a surprising one "It has an infantile prototype, of which it is in fact only the continuation. For once before one has found oneself in a similar state of helplessness: as a small child, in relation to one's parents. One had reason to fear them, and especially one's father; and yet one was sure of his protection against the dangers one knew."

        1.4.4.1.3. Pro:
        There is also a precedent for this behaviour from the social structures of our genetic ancestors as primates [512] dominated by a single alpha male - In The Naked Ape (1967), the zoologist Desmond Morris wrote that religion’s ‘extreme potency’ is simply a ‘measure of the strength of our fundamental biological tendency, inherited directly from our monkey and ape ancestors, to submit ourselves to an all-powerful, dominant member of the group’. Hector Garcia's Alpha God [513] explores this connection in depth.

        1.4.4.1.5. Con:
        This argument could be represented: 
        
        1. If groups of people assign an individual that represents their shared goals with infinite power, then belief in God is a consequence of the human desire for power. 
        2. Groups of people assign an individual that represents their shared goals with infinite power.
        3. Therefore, belief in God is a consequence of the human desire for power. 
        4. Therefore, God does not exist!?!
        
        (4) in no way follows as a conclusion and is a non-sequitur.

          1.4.4.1.5.1. Con:
          4 Therefore the cause of human belief in God is not God.
          
          Then why should we think God Exists in the first place? Without some just cause for the belief, we would be committing the fallacy of privileging the hypothesis [514].

            1.4.4.1.5.1.2. Con:
            The parent forgets this is an argument against God’s existence  and bears the burden of proof.  The parent is an attempt to shift the burden of proof. Therefore, the parent fails to avoid the non sequitur.

              1.4.4.1.5.1.2.1. Con:
              The burden of proof is on those who make the claim in this case the claim is that god exists and this argument is saying there is no reason to believe that.

            1.4.4.1.5.1.3. Con:
            Even if this is an argument against God as an explanation,  this is still a non sequitur. We cannot conclude God is not a valid explanation based on this line of argument alone.

            1.4.4.1.5.1.4. Con:
            5.  Therefore God does not exist. This is still a non sequitur

      1.4.4.2. Pro:
      God is a figment of human imagination, and is therefore no more real than fire-breathing dragons and pink unicorns. Pre-scientific, pre-industrial people who knew less than we do made up supernatural (i.e. "fake") explanations based on superstition which were exaggerated over time.

        1.4.4.2.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.6.1.2.4.2.10.1.1.

        1.4.4.2.2. Pro:
        Religion is a natural human tendency and failing. The cargo cults of Melanesia [515] demonstrate how religious belief can arise from ignorance. God is just one more example.

          1.4.4.2.2.1. Con:
          Parent assumes that all who have chosen to believe in God are unintelligent, when historically,some very great scientific minds [516] were theists.

          1.4.4.2.2.2. Con:
          The parent could be summarized as follows:
          
          1. Religion is a natural human tendency. 
          2. Therefore, God does not exist?!?!?
          
          (2) is a non sequitur. Therefore, this argument does not stand against the thesis, “God exists.”

            1.4.4.2.2.2.1. Con:
            1. Religion is a natural human tendency.
            2. We know, that people are able to believe in false religions.
            3. Therefore God could be part of a false religion and doesn't exist.
            
            Russell's teapot - If God could not exist, we don't need to further disprove it.

          1.4.4.2.2.3. Con:
          A natural tendency or natural predisposition to believe in God is right at home and consistent with some forms of theism. For instance, on Christianity, we would expect to find that humans have this tendency (Ecclesiastes 3:11, Romans 1:20). There is nothing inconsistent with accepting this belief and believing God exists.

        1.4.4.2.3. Pro:
        Humans have imagined a great diversity of gods throughout history. But their conceptions are mutually contradictory, so most theists must disbelieve most of them. And monotheists must disbelive in all the others. Is it such a stretch to disbelieve in just one more God when we know all the others are false?

          1.4.4.2.3.1. Con:

          1.4.4.2.3.2. Con:
          According to the parent’s reasoning, in any scientific inquiry in which hundreds of hypotheses are proposed and then proven false, it would follow that any future hypothesis would have to be false. This is obviously absurd and thus this is a weak inductive argument.

          1. Humans have imagined a great diversity of gods throughout history. 
          2. Most of these gods are contradictory.
          3. Because of these contradictions theists disbelieve in most of them. 
          4. Monotheists disbelieve in all but one. 
          5. Therefore, God is a figment of human imagination. 
          6. Therefore, God doesn’t exist.

            1.4.4.2.3.4.2. Con:
            Regarding point 5: Homo sapiens have wandered this planet for 200,000 - 300,000 years, and the oldest recording of (very primitive) writing is from only circa 3,100 BC. Therefore, we have had the Bible (the written record of God) for about 1.66 - 2.5% of our total existence. Who was God before then?

        1.4.4.2.4. Con:
        Belief in God, if a figment of human imagination, is unlike belief in pink unicorns or fire-breathing dragons. The majority of humans are theistic, whereas it would be extremely difficult to find one adult who believes in pink unicorns or fire-breathing dragons. Also, dismissing the Bible (assuming that is the "stuff" referred to here) as fiction from ancient goat herders is contrary to the evidence for authorship.

          1.4.4.2.4.1. Con:
          -> See 1.3.14.1.1.2.1.3.1.

          1.4.4.2.4.2. Con:
          Calling theists a unified majority is misleading. They believe in contradictory versions of god(s)/supernatural entities, many of which are even more ridiculous than pink unicorns.

          1.4.4.2.4.3. Con:
          The claim stands correct. The same books that mention god have descriptions of human and animal mutated centaurs and multiple instances of dragon like reptile creatures breathing fire. So belief in God comes along with belief in unicorns and dragons.

        1.4.4.2.5. Pro:
        -> See 1.1.6.1.2.4.2.10.1.1.1.

        1.4.4.2.6. Pro:
        The origin of the monotheistic God myth can be traced to a fusion of gods from older Mesopotamian myths. These traditions are known to be corrupt. Thus, for god belief to be warranted, the theist must provide evidence independent of corrupt traditions.

          -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.

          1.4.4.2.6.2. Con:
          The parent could be summarized as follows:
          
          1. The origin of the monotheistic God myth can be traced to a fusion of gods from older Mesopotamian myths. 
          2. Therefore, a monotheistic God doesn’t exist!?!?
          
          (2) is a non sequitur. Therefore, this argument does not stand against the thesis, “God exists.”

        1.4.4.2.7. Con:
        Saying that God is a figment of imagination is not evidence for or against the existence of God, it is an unsupported claim. Naming the past possible creation of the claim suggested is no more support of the claim then the claim its self.

          1.4.4.2.7.1. Con:
          The dragons are exists in the imaginary world of humans. But if we try to find dragons in "real" world, there are not. We are able to find out, what probably led to this fictional creation (bones of dinosaurs...). With God, we can't find direct proof, but we can find out, what would probably led to it's creation. So God is exist, but the same way, as dragons (in fantasy).

          1.4.4.2.7.2. Con:
          It is one of the most supported claims ever. God is a figment of imagination because the stories related to such a being have been found false on scientific standards. The timeline of the stories, the supernatural and paranormal claims, the origin of the universe and life present in the books of religions have all been debunked.

        1.4.4.2.8. Pro:
        It is highly probable that God is a construct from our imagination to explain our environment, our origin, and our purpose. Creating supernatural explanations through religion filled a hole that we can now fill with scientific theory and supporting facts. Evidence of this is the fact that every human society throughout recorded history has unique monotheistic and/or polytheistic beliefs.

          1.4.4.2.8.1. Pro:
          People tend to believe in Invisible agents controling the world [517]

        1.4.4.2.9. Pro:
        God is a figment of human imagination as evidenced by the fact that the God construct and Bible/Quran  reflect the morals/values of human society that existed at the time the God concept was created...over two thousand years ago. Take the 10 commandments for example.  Thou shall not covet...wife, ass, and other chattel.  This wouldn't appear in any rules a right thinking person would create in today's world since women aren't possessions and thought crimes harm no one.

          1.4.4.2.9.1. Pro:

          1.4.4.2.9.2. Con:
          The Quran was written about 500 years after the New Testament. Therefore, the parent represents a gross misrepresentation of ancient writings and makes one wonder if it understands them at all.

            1.4.4.2.9.2.1. Con:
            Quran represents different values of different group. Also New Testament reflects circumstances of it's origin.

          1.4.4.2.9.3. Con:
          The parent could be summarized as follows:
          
          1. The God constructed in the Bible/Quran reflect the morals/values of human society that existed at the time the God concept was created. 
          2. Therefore, God does not exist?!?!?
          
          (2) is a non sequitur. Therefore, this argument does not stand against the thesis, “God exists.”

            1.4.4.2.9.3.1. Con:
            1. The God suppose to create these laws.
            2. But these laws are not universal, but reflect the group.
            3. Therefore the group likely made these laws.'
            4. Therefore God doesn't have to exist.

            1.4.4.2.9.3.2. Con:
            The parent meant that the books are man made and not so called divine. The laws were made by men and to be able to force the laws on the masses,  an idea of a supernatural being was used by the rulers of the time.

        1.4.4.2.10. Con:
        The parent could be summarized as follows:
        
        1. In the pre-scientific era, humans made up gods  to explain natural phenomena they didn’t understand. 
        2. It has been proven these gods do not exist and were false explanations for observed natural phenomena. 
        3. Therefore, God doesn’t exist!?!?
        
        (3) is an incorrect conclusion that doesn’t follow from the evidence. Therefore, this argument is weak and does not stand  as evidence against the thesis, “God exists.”

          1.4.4.2.10.1. Con:
          -> See 1.4.4.2.2.2.1.

          1.4.4.2.10.2. Con:
          Point 1 and 2 are correct but point 3 has been misrepresented. Point 3 should be, since all definitions of god have been proven false hence its proved that no god,  as per the existing definitions,  exists. If there is any uncontested definition then please mention.

        1.4.4.2.11. Con:
        By definition, God existed before humans, therefore, human imagination did not exist until humans were created.

          1.4.4.2.11.1. Con:
          The parent sneaks "God existed" into the "by definition", thus it fallaciously begs the thesis [518] that "God Exists". Such reasoning is circular [519], and thus wholly unpersuasive.

        1.4.4.2.12. Pro:
        The idea of God’s existence depends on man’s desperate need for a miracle from an Omnipotent Being. God may not exist. But man, in his desperate need of God’s Omnipotence & Miraculous Help, appears to “will” His existence & hope for His Miraculous Help. E.g., a regular church-going friend lost his spouse to death & stopped attending church, blaming God for her death. It seems God is held responsible for both good & bad tidings when He may not even exist.

          1.4.4.2.12.1. Pro:
          Man’s need for security may have led him to “will”/imagine/rationalize the existence of God. A person may feel the need for an All-powerful Being to care for, protect and help him especially in times of need & desperation & may find ways to justify/rationalize this Omnipotent Being’s existence, possibly using wrong or absurd reasons.

        1.4.4.2.13. Pro:
        If a philanthropist or philanthropic/governmental organization could play God by helping anyone in need in every way, would the existence of God matter? Despite the lack of physical evidence of His existence, many cling on to God out of hope & perhaps desperation, seemingly “willing” His existence. God appears to be a Creation in the Consciousness or a By-product of Consciousness. Likewise some may seek help from spirits who appear to exist & have supernatural powers.

          1.4.4.2.13.1. Con:
          Any finite lifespan is shorter than eternity. The existence of God demonstrates the possibility of immortality, so it would still matter.

        1.4.4.2.14. Pro:
        The existence of God, wherein physical evidence is lacking, appears to be a creation of the mind. It is not difficult to hold in the mind or imagine an Omnipotent, Perfect Being who is PERFECTLY, ABSOLUTELY powerful, kind, honest, helpful, charitable, good (perfect) in character, trustworthy. This Omnipotent, Perfect Being could well be a new Superhero in a Marvel or DC comic adventure Who is more perfect and powerful than superheroes such as Superman and Spiderman.

        1.4.4.2.15. Pro:
        All the science in the world cannot prove that something in someone’s mind that they are told is true by everything they have ever trusted is false. So it really doesn’t matter if it’s false or not because someone could just will it into existence...

      1.4.4.3. Pro:
      God is a human construct made for the sole purpose of bringing peace and providing hope. Though the concept of god has brought hope, it has also brought about more chaos than peace due to the fact that there are many different interpretations of god.

        1.4.4.3.1. Con:
        -> See 1.1.6.1.2.4.2.10.1.1.

        1.4.4.3.2. Con:
        This argument got weak when it said "sole purpose".  Surely there are more purposes for God, such as for explaining the creation of the world.

          1.4.4.3.2.1. Con:
          We do not need God to explain the creation of the world, we can discover it through science and get more definitive answers rather than vague and simplistic ideas.

      1.4.4.4. Pro:
      God(s), religion, spirituality are concepts, ideas, notions, opinions, thoughts, theories, BELIEFS. It is a thought; without form. The most basic definition then is, it is a non-existence, a negative and you must have something before you can prove or disprove it. Therefore, you have a nonexistence, a thought, idea, concept, belief. You can not argue, prove or disprove a thought. Ergo, it does not exist in the physical realm, only in the mind, and if the mind ceases then so does the idea.

        -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.7.1.1.1.2.2.5.1.1.1.

      1.4.4.5. Pro:
      The classical God is apparently an imagined God who is infinitely powerful, perfect, immortal, moral, etc., with all the ideal qualities imaginable. Proving His existence is likely impossible as He probably exists only in the imagination & not in reality. A more realistic, possible God may be a Spiritual Being with some supernatural powers but not infinite powers. If man could lower his expectations he might find a God in some real person with superior powers instead.

        1.4.4.5.1. Pro:
        As proving the existence of a God with infinite powers is likely impossible as He probably doesn’t exist, the sensible recourse is to evaluate His possible existence by utilizing reasoning & probability. By comparing the no. of arguments for & the no. of arguments against His existence, i.e., the no. of Pro’s & the no. of Con’s of His possible existence, e.g., it could be concluded whether He’s likely to exist or not.

        1.4.4.5.2. Pro:
        The classical God is an infinitely powerful/perfect One able to create perfect things.Nature is imperfect.God couldn’t have created an imperfect nature as He’s capable of creating a perfect nature.As there’s much evil,suffering,violence in nature it could also not have been God’s work since He has perfect character/morals & wouldn't allow evil,suffering,violence.Thus nature either exists spontaneously or is created by another entity.The classical God may not exist in reality but only as an idea.

    1.4.5. Pro:
    We do not have reliable access to God. Thus, belief in God is unjustified.

      1.4.5.1. Pro:
      God as a construct of man exists. That can be proven. God the creator and supreme being cannot be proven with hard evidence - If it can't be proven then the default answer is false.

        1.4.5.1.1. Con:
        "If it can't be proven then the default answer is false," can't be proven with hard evidence. Therefore, the parent is self-defeating.

        1.4.5.1.2. Pro:
        The proof of the existence of God should be based on hard incontrovertible physical or experimental evidence & not just reasoning.

      1.4.5.2. Pro:
      Evidence is, by definition, observed in nature.  Since there is no evidence of the supernatural, and it, by definition, exists outside nature, it can be concluded that god also exists outside nature, which is equivalent to nonexistence.

        1.4.5.2.1. Con:
        “Evidence is only observed in nature,” is a propositional statement that requires evidence. There is no evidence observed in nature to support the proposition. Therefore, the statement is self-defeating.

        1.4.5.2.2. Con:
        To say “God exists outside of nature” is “equivalent to non-existence” is a non-sequitur. It doesn’t follow that just because we can’t observe something with the natural sciences (life science like biology or physical sciences like chemistry, physics), it doesn’t exist.

          1.4.5.2.2.1. Pro:
          Numbers exist but cannot be observed by the natural sciences.

            1.4.5.2.2.1.1. Con:
            Numbers are abstract objects. They don’t really exist.

      1.4.5.3. Pro:
      We can't check everywhere in the universe at the same time using all possible methods to see if something exists
      
      you can't prove this statement false
      you can prove the opposite statement to be false
      
      the opposite statement has never been proven to be false
      
      We can't assume everything that we haven't seen before exists until proven otherwise:
      (example)
      I claim 'space unicorns exist but are constantly moving and hiding'
      The only way to prove me wrong is to check everywhere in all of space at once

        1.4.5.3.2. Con:
        It is self-defeating to claim that we can’t know something to be real just because we can’t detect it with our physical senses because we cannot verify the reliability of our physical senses using our physical senses.

      1.4.5.4. Pro:
      Trying to parse motions like "God exists" is necessarily about asking whether we have reliable access to know whether God exists. To do this, God needs to be defined and reliable access to knowledge needs to be demonstrated. In this case, the word "exists" also needs to be defined (as all other existence we have examples of is both temporal and spatial, and yet many God claims are not). Reliable access to God is yet to be demonstrated, and therefore we do not have that knowledge.

        1.4.5.4.4. Con:
        Reliablism doesn't entail truth. Reliablism is simply a strategy for error reduction. Other theories of human knowledge are error tolerant. For example, Dialetheism is better suited to contradiction than the LNC. Here, Dretske, Peacocke, and others are better suited to discuss God because of entitlement; no evidence exists for any disposition about God's existence and sound arguments for and against exist; acceptance of either is from preceptions of experience. Reliablism is irrelevant.

    1.4.6. Pro:
    Since sound arguments can be made for and against the existence of God, one believes either argument aside from logic and reason. One believes or disbelieves based on what seems reasonable. This kind of belief is called "entitlement". It is a perception from experience. Logic itself doesn't entail truth nor proves anything. It's a formal description of how folks think.

      1.4.6.1. Pro:
      I'm suggesting that logic and evidence do not matter to belief that its true there are deity or to belief that it's untrue there are deity. So, what matters to beliefs having warrant here are via entitlements. In that case, the rest is just rhetoric.

        1.4.6.1.1. Pro:
        The problem with the concept of god in particular is that by definition god refuses to be pinned down or fully understood. Supposedly the grand master behind it all, 'it all' happens to be not fully understood yet either i.e. physics of the universe

      1.4.6.3. Con:
      If it is true that "one believes or disbelieves based on what seems reasonable (entitlement)," then that very statement is also an entitlement.

        1.4.6.3.1. Con:
        The parent is a false equivalent. Entitlements are warranted beliefs for which we may have no reasons to give for the warrant or may even be unaware of what those reasons are. Reasonableness is a sense about the way things generally are, and this is not an entitlement. It is simply a brute fact about how brains function.

          1.4.6.3.1.1. Con:
          The belief in the existence of any brute fact would also be an entitlement under this view. To conclude that a brute fact exists one would have to reason that since there are only x number of possible explanations for y, and none of those explanations actually explain y, y must be inexplicable.

    1.4.7. Pro:
    God as an explanation does not explain anything.

      1.4.7.1. Pro:
      -> See 1.1.6.1.2.4.2.

      1.4.7.2. Con:
      God can explain everything as He is the only omniscient being in the Universe and outside of it. Problem is, there are a many things that we could not comprehend because of our limitations. An honest person will acknowledge that men will never be able to comprehend more that is enabled to comprehend. And infinity, eternity, unlimited knowledge and understanding, unlimited power, etc. are abilities that humans can never achieve, precisely because of our limitations.

        1.4.7.2.1. Con:
        The parent literally says god explains everything because he exists and is omniscient etc. This is a circular argument and assumes the existence of god to object to the grandparent.

      1.4.7.3. Pro:
      We are justified in rejecting unfalsifiable claims until they are constructed as falsifiable claims, at which point the claim still carries a burden of proof. Therefore, we are justified in rejecting a God for the same reason.

        1.4.7.3.2. Con:
        The project of natural theology demonstrates that the thesis “God Exists,” is falsifiable. Natural theology provides valid deductive arguments with premises that are more probably true than false, and in some cases are reinforced by inductive evidence (when appropriate). The premises of these arguments can be refuted as evidenced quite extensively by this Kialo discussion.

          1.4.7.3.2.1. Con:
          What is evidenced by this discussion is that any rebuttal to God's existence can be met with something akin to "You don't know God isn't doing that" i.e. No matter that the natural explanation for something might be, or how an argument doesn't actually lead to a God, one can continue to assert that God is the explanation at a deeper level or that a failed argument for God also doesn't definitively rule out God.
          That is unfalsifiable.

          1.4.7.3.2.2. Con:
          The teleological argument for God's existence -- as part of natural theology -- is not falsifiable. This is because there is no possible universe we could conceive of that would also rule out that a God made it.

            1.4.7.3.2.2.1. Con:
            The teleological argument is falsifiable. It is possible the fine-tuning of the universe is caused by necessity or chance. The existence of these possibilities and our ability to evaluate them makes the arguments propositions falsifiable.

            1.4.7.3.2.2.2. Pro:
            Because God is "mysterious" and given excuses like a possible (but undefined) "morally sufficient reason", even a universe consisting only of rocks or of one conscious being in perpetual agony could fit.
            This is because any data can make the arguments in Natural Theology work, because they are unfalsifiable.

            1.4.7.3.2.2.3. Con:
            The parent demonstrates a poor understanding of the teleological argument which hypothesizes a designer as the best explanation for the fine tuning of the universe. There are many possible worlds we can think of that don’t incorporate fine tuning. In those worlds, while we still couldn’t rule out the existence of deity, certain propositions of the teleological argument would certainly be false.

          1.4.7.3.2.5. Pro:
          There are three requirements [522] to make a proposition unfalsifiable. The proposition must not be contradictable by any observation or outcome of a physical experiment, be confidently asserted, and have little to no evidence.

        Rejecting something that does not exist is an oxymoron. If you reject God is because God exists. If God doesn't exist, you cannot reject Him.

          1.4.7.3.7.1. Con:
          This is a straw man atheists reject the proposition that god exists they do not reject god himself since they do not believe he exists.

        1.4.7.3.8. Pro:
        The proof of anything, e.g., the existence of God, should be based on hard physical or experimental evidence, e.g., the CCTV captures the culprit carrying out the robbery in the shop resulting in him being caught and convicted - using reasoning alone to prove that the culprit has carried out the robbery in the shop would not do, unless there are witness or witnesses to support it. There's no physical evidence of God’s existence.

          1.4.7.3.8.1. Pro:
          The proof of anything, e.g., the existence of God, should be based on hard physical or experimental evidence if it were to be scientific. From the scientific point of view, reasoning or theory is insufficient; the theory needs to be backed by physical or experimental evidence, e.g., in physics the Higgs boson had been predicted many years ago & it had only recently been detected through physical experiment resulting in a Nobel Prize. There's no such physical evidence of God’s existence.

          1.4.7.3.8.2. Pro:
          The proof of the existence of God should be based on hard incontrovertible physical or experimental evidence & not just reasoning, e.g., the image and/or voice of God or at least His shadow or some other manifestation which could be seen and/or heard & captured on film or video, which may be obtainable though possibly very difficult or unlikely.

        1.4.7.3.10. Con:
        "We are justified in rejecting unfalsifiable claims" is not, itself, a falsifiable claim under this view. Therefore the argument defeats itself.

          1.4.7.3.10.1. Con:
          Consider the consequences of not rejecting unfalsifiable claims in general. If they are not bad then the "justification" has been falsified. Thus, "We are justified in rejecting unfalsifiable claims" is a falsifiable claim.

            1.4.7.3.10.1.1. Pro:
            If the parent is true, then there is no problem for the proposition, “God exists.” One can simply review valid arguments for the proposition, “God does not exist.” If one finds these arguments compelling then “God exists” is a falsifiable claim by the law of the excluded middle.

      1.4.7.4. Pro:
      To say there is morality because of God is to say God is the sort of thing that causes morality. God is clearly then only a tautological way of stating brute facts; there is morality, there is logic, there is math, there are toothaches, there are cute and fluffy bunnies. God is then useless not only as an explanation for these things, God is a term whose referent isn't the transcendent but simply these brute facts.

    1.5.3. Pro:
    While God may exist, theistic arguments do not always agree on what God is (not just in different religions, but within denominations). Given this, a theist must posit the definition of God they intend to argue for in order for the claim of “God Exists” to hold value.

      1.5.3.1. Con:
      It is true that some arguments may argue for a monotheistic type of God or perhaps a pantheistic; however, there are arguments that could be applicable to all. Moreover, there are also arguments that arrive at certain attributes of God that are more consistent with certain forms of theism than others. However, these are all inconsistent with atheism and hard agnosticism. So we don't need to have a perfect definition of God to accumulate evidence against atheism and hard agnosticism.

        1.5.3.1.1. Con:
        The position the original argument takes is that a god does exist. It is therefore pertinent to get a working definition of how a god is actually defined.

          1.5.3.1.1.1. Con:
          It is sufficient to demonstrate atheism (defending "God does not exist") and hard agnosticism (defending "we can't know if God exists") to be false. The only remaining options are theism (defending "God or some set of gods (polytheism) exist") and soft agnosticism (an admission that one doesn't know and isn't convinced either way). Moreover, the definition of God being argued for or against is typically contained within the individual arguments given.

            1.5.3.1.1.1.1. Con:
            A demonstration that positions that do not accept that a god exists are wrong still requires a working definition of the term "god".

          1.5.3.1.1.2. Con:
          God is defined in the Super Parent as the Classical Theistic model according to the moderators.

      1.5.3.2. Pro:
      Arguments require definitions for the sake of consistency.

        1.5.3.2.1. Con:
        Right, but lack of or inaccurate definitions are methodological failures. This does not necessitate that the thesis is false.

      1.5.3.4. Con:
      The God (or lack of god) being argued for or against is usually clear in any given argument, unless it is attempting to arrive at attributes.

      1.5.3.5. Con:
      While Black Holes may exist, science doesn't always agree on what a Black Hole is. Given this, science must present an undeniable, verifiable, observable and falsifiable proof of the existence of a Black Hole in order to claim that Black Holes exist.

    2. God is immortal, i.e., (s)he cannot die.
    3. The first two statements contradict each other; since God cannot die, (s)he cannot do literally anything.  Therefore, God violates the rules of logic and cannot exist.

        1.5.4.2.1. Con:
        According to Christians god is a trinity with Jesus being only one part of it and thus god did not die on the cross.

          1.5.4.2.1.1. Con:
          Trinitarian theory is that the 3 parts are of One Whole they are distinct, yet not separate.

        1.5.4.2.2. Pro:
        The Trinitarian existence of God is exactly why, and how He can send a physical manifestation to earth to become the sacrificial offering to fulfill His own requirements (laws) about acceptance of His fallen creation— to restore relationship with Him which humans had when they were first introduced (which had always been His goal).

    1.5.5. Pro:
    There are two identical universes. One with a God and the other without. Since all features of either universe do not logically belie the existence or necessity of a deity, we can discard claims that God is necessary for the existence of any and all universes, just as we can discard claims no universe requires gods in order to exist at all.
    
    If no distinction between the two can be made, arguments about the existence of deity are useless and ultimately unconvincing.

      1.5.5.2. Con:
      Arguments for God's existence are built upon evidence which requires human interpretation and will have multiple explanations. Unless we adopt some form of skepticism, as we evaluate the evidence, certain possible explanations of the evidence are ruled out entirely. Similarly, some are made more plausible. Therefore, the arguments for God's existence, while not proving with perfect certainty that God exists, hypothesize God as the best explanation of the evidence. This is far from useless.

        1.5.5.2.1. Con:
        There can be no evidence for transcendent realities. By definition, such realities are beyond evidence.

          1.5.5.2.1.1. Con:
          There are arguments for God’s existence that do not assume anything about God’s attributes, including His transcendence. Versions of the Kalaam Cosmological argument, Leibniz’s Cosmological argument, and Teleological argument are good examples.

            1.5.5.2.1.1.1. Con:
            Most of these arguments necessary entail transcendence because they posit am eternal, non temporal being.

              1.5.5.2.1.1.1.1. Con:
              They conclude an eternal, non temporal being as the best explanation for why the universe exists rather than nothing, the uncaused first-cause of the universe, and the fine-tuning of the universe. Transcendence is not assumed, it is arrived at. Moreover, these arguments do not exclude the possibility of God becoming temporal [523] subsequent to creation.

          1.5.5.2.1.2. Con:
          To say, “there can be no evidence for transcendent realities” is to assume that God exists in some sort of transcendent reality, doesn’t interact with the universe or humanity, or is beyond the reach of human thought. These assumptions aren’t necessarily true.

            1.5.5.2.1.2.1. Con:
            No! It is to say if one defines God as transcendent, then nothing can be known about God. If God is imminent, then God is indistinguishable from reality; a simple synonym.

              1.5.5.2.1.2.1.1. Con:
              Then the objection is trivial. The arguments for God’s existence do not define God as transcendent. They conclude that God has attributes consistent with transcendence sans creation. This has little to do with our current knowledge of God. It is possible He has made Himself temporal [524] and therefore, knowable.

        1.5.5.2.2. Con:
        If I ask, "what is god" and the term is essentially, "god is the cause of x, y, and z", then saying god explains x, y, and z is absurd. God is tautologically "that which causes". therefore, x, y, and z aren't explained! It is to say, and only say, that x, y, and z are caused.

          1.5.5.2.2.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.9.1.26.1.4.2.

          1.5.5.2.2.2. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.7.3.5.1.1.3.4.2.1.1.1.1.2.1.2.4.2.2.1.2.3.

          1.5.5.2.2.3. Con:
          -> See 1.1.9.1.26.1.1.

    1.5.6. Pro:
    The god of the Bible can't be omnibenevolent due to all the evil deeds it says he has done.

    1.5.7. Pro:
    The typical and very commonly defended definition of God is incoherent, and the words used to describe him have no meaning. There is no understood concept for something to be all powerful, along with all-knowing. How can we determine if there is a possibility for something non-physical to "exist" outside of space and time, and somehow have causal influence. The definition doesn't seem coherent, or capable to be reasonably understood. Defense of such a definition would be difficult.

      1.5.7.1. Pro:
      Omniscience and omnipotence cannot be used to describe one entity. If an entity is omniscient, that means it has no limits to knowledge, and what can be known. If it is also omnipotent, then there is no limit to the capability of said being. An omniscient being would have no reason to change its mind, being that it knows all outcomes, but then that would be an action it is not capable of, meaning it cannot be omnipotent. If it can change its mind, then it could not foresee that outcome.

        1.5.7.1.1. Con:
        It is true an omniscient being could not “change His mind” because he foreknows all his decisions. God doesn’t decide anything except in relations with temporal beings and even these are not a “decision” as He foreknew them. But there is no contradiction between this and omnipotence. Omnipotence is recognized by most theologians as the power and ability to do anything that is logically possible. If changing His mind is logically impossible, then God changing His mind would be an imperfection.

          1.5.7.1.1.1. Pro:
          -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.

        1.5.7.1.2. Con:
        -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.2.1.2.1.1.

      1.5.7.2. Con:
      It is a 'Strawman Fallacy' to refute a non-defended claim that God is 'All Powerful, All Knowing, and All Loving'. At the very least, this is a hasty generalization of what some might have argued—and taken out of context. But regardless, it is an obviously deliberate mischaracterization of theism and Biblical texts. Specifically, there are many well-known statements reportedly made by God himself that repudiate these premises.

        1.5.7.2.1. Pro:
        God, not being stronger than himself, has bound himself by oaths that he cannot break and is therefore not all-powerful. Hebrews 6:17-18 [525], Isaiah 45:23 [526].

          1.5.7.2.1.1. Con:
          Whether an omnipotent being is able to make an oath they cannot break, or to break an oath that they made, is a paradox. People who believe in an omnipotent God generally either define omnipotence differently, or believe that omnipotence is capable of defying logic.

        1.5.7.2.2. Pro:
        God forgives and even choses to forget and is therefore not all-knowing. Jeremiah 23:39 [527], Isaiah 65:17 [528], Jeremiah 31:34 [529].

          1.5.7.2.2.1. Con:
          Here's several [530] Christian [531] websites [532] explaining how the omniscient God that they believe in can still choose to forget. Regardless of the validity of their arguments, it proves at minimum that a portion of Christians believe in such an omniscient God.

        1.5.7.2.3. Pro:
        God has said he hates and therefore cannot be all-loving. Malachai 1:3 [533], Hosea 9:15 [534], Jeremiah 12:7-8 [535].

      1.5.7.3. Pro:
      If god had created the universe, he would have done it out of his will. But will comes out of the lack of something. Having a wish, a desire, implies lacking something. This goes against the idea that god is perfect and self suficient. If he created the universe, he has will. If he has will, he has desires. If he has desires, he's not perfect. If he's not perfect, he's not god.

        1.5.7.3.1. Con:
        There is no reason to think that God created out of any need satisfied by free creatures. For example, in Christianity, God is triune (3 persons in 1 being) and these persons existed eternally together and had no needs. If the Christian God exists, God wanted to share his perfect happiness and completeness with free creatures of His making. Far from pointing out some imperfection or “lack” in God, this demonstrates profound love and selflessness. Thus God choosing to create is a perfection.

          1.5.7.3.1.1. Con:
          -> See 1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.2.1.1.3.2.1.1.3.1.2.2.2.1.1.1.2.1.2.2.1.

      1.5.7.4. Pro:
      The price of being able to predict the future, is not being able to influence it.   Once you predict it accurately, then you have lost all power to change it as the variability required to do that would break your prediction.
      Therefore it is impossible to be all powerful and all knowing at the same time.

        1.5.7.4.1. Con:
        If God has middle knowledge (knowledge of all contingencies) then He would know every possible world that could be brought into existence. Therefore, the world being brought into existence is exactly what this God wills and diversion from that world and plan would be a deep imperfection in this being because it would imply the world He picked was incorrect. Thus neither omnipotence nor omniscience is compromised.

      1.5.7.5. Con:
      -> See 1.1.4.2.3.1.2.4.1.1.1.3.3.

  1.6. Con:
  This topic is utterly invalid, deliberately written to be dismissive and an insult for such irrational boasts—claims that theists, in context, never made. Contrary to the presuppositions, the truth: 1.) These purported, limited, attributes of God aren't what so-called 'classical monotheists' defend—rather many other aspects; 2.) In context, theists do not claim 'God is all-knowing, all-powerful, and all-loving'. Theists, Biblical texts—especially statements attributed to God—refute this.

    1.6.1. Pro:
    -> See 1.5.7.2.1.

    1.6.2. Pro:
    -> See 1.5.7.2.2.

    1.6.3. Pro:
    -> See 1.5.7.2.3.

    1.6.4. Con:
    The fact that the logical problem of evil [536] has been a subject of philosophical and theological debate for millenia, suggests that at least some theists believe in a God with all three "omni-" traits.

    1.6.5. Con:
    "Theists" are a large category that include all theistic religions, as well as non-religious deists; even if one could show from the bible that the Christian God does not have these properties, that would not apply to "theists" as a class, who do not all believe in the bible.

    1.6.6. Con:
    Many and possibly most monotheists believe in a God with such aspects even if such is technically refuted in religious scriptures or many theist theologians do not believe in these aspects.

    1.6.7. Con:
    The majority of this debate also applies to theist beliefs or respective God(s) where such descriptions are inaccurate and largely does not rely on these aspects being accurate.

    1.6.8. Con:
    At least a rough definition of what the term God means or refers to is necessary to address the concept and debate the subject.

    1.6.9. Con:
    There are no properly interpreted Biblical texts, taken in context, that refute these.

"If we extrapolate this prediction to its extreme [expansion], we reach a point when all distances in the universe have shrunk to zero. An initial cosmological singularity therefore forms a past temporal extremity to the universe. We cannot continue physical reasoning, or even the concept of spacetime, through such an extremity. For this reason most cosmologists think of the initial singularity as the beginning of the universe."
