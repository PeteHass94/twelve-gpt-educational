1.,0,Thesis,"The God of classical monotheism (omniscient, omnipotent, and omnibenevolent mind) exists.
",,
1.1.,1,Pro,"  There are sound arguments for God.
",,
1.1.1.,2,Pro,"    Free Will exists, and Free Will cannot be generated by a cause that does not possess Free Will. Therefore, a cause with Free Will must always have existed. This is God
",,
1.1.1.1.,3,Pro,"      Free will is non-deterministic order. Deterministic systems produce only deterministic things, and random systems produce only randomness. Therefore, non-deterministic order cannot be the product of deterministic order or randomness, so it can only be the product of another instance of non-deterministic order.
",,
1.1.1.1.1.,4,Con,"        Randomness can cause order and be predictable at scale. Statistics is the study of that.
",,
1.1.1.1.1.1.,5,Con,"          Randomness is the quality or state of lacking a pattern or principle of organization; unpredictability. A descriptive quality or state doesn’t cause anything to happen much less exist.
",,
1.1.1.1.2.,4,Con,"        Free will is deterministic. It seems non-deterministic because it's so complex of a system that we, today, don't have the ability to compute it entirely. What we see as random results are results that are unpredictable, but which do come from a complex deterministic system.
",,
1.1.1.1.3.,4,Con,"        Free will is actually deterministic. We are free to exercise choices which are influenced by our experiences, upbringing, values, education, beliefs, biological drives, society and desires. The fact that a person's choices are predictable makes free will deterministic.
",,
1.1.1.1.3.1.,5,Con,"          Predictability and Determinism are distinct and separate things. The assumption that they are the same begs the question.
",,
1.1.1.1.3.1.1.,6,Con,"            Determinism is not assumed to be the same as predictability. Predictability is a consequence of determinism.
",,
1.1.1.2.,3,Con,"      Free will is an illusion. With a sufficient understanding of the human brain, the decisions humans make can be predicted. Free will is simply an emergent property of a complex system.
",,
1.1.1.2.1.,4,Pro,"        Researchers have been able to predict simple and deliberate decisions participants in fMRI scanners will make before the participant is aware they have made up their mind. ncbi.nlm.nih.gov [1]

1.1.1.2.2.1.,5,Pro,"          The human soul [2] (mind) exists.
",2,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.,6,Con,"            The existence of the human brain is evidence against the supernatural because it is unclear why souls require brains.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.,7,Con,"              It is an unwarranted assumption to conclude that a simple transceiver would suffice in place of a brain for a soul to interact with the physical world because there would be nothing in place to interpret the commands.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.,8,Con,"                If the soul was the mind and the seat of consciousness then the only thing the brain would need to do would be receive information from the soul, decode it, and send it to the rest of the body. The same is true in the reverse direction it would need to receive the senses encode them and send them to the soul. In reality though the brain is a processing unit filled with neural networks that process information themselves without the need to outsource the computing to a soul.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1.,9,Con,"                  The brain may be all the body needs to process physical stimuli; however, the soul is not claimed to conduct these functions for a person but to rather process non-physical stimuli.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.2.,8,Pro,"                Transceivers only send and receive signals. Something must exist to interpret and execute those signals. Even simple RC cars [3] use complex circuit boards to execute a received command.
",3,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.1.3.,8,Pro,"                A signal can be sent to a device. That device can even receive that signal. But without something else to turn that signal into action (e.g. a processor), nothing would happen.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.,7,Con,"              Souls existing in their own right does not impede brains from existing. Existence is not perfectly efficient.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.2.1.,8,Con,"                In the abstract, existence is not efficient, but in living creatures, evolution is a relentless seeker of efficiency. If the soul makes parts of the brain redundant, then those parts of the brain should have been sanded off by natural selection eons ago.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.3.,7,Pro,"              On supernaturalism, minds could exist in their own right as an immaterial (or substance-dual) soul. If souls could fulfill the brain's function, we would have no need of brains that take 1/5th of the body's energy. A simple transceiver would suffice.

",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.1.3.2.,8,Con,"                Strawman: It is not claimed that a soul can fulfill the brain's functions. The claim is that the soul needs to animate a physical body to interact with the physical world.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.,6,Pro,"            Billions of people across time and physical locations have claimed to have an experience involving the spiritual world. This, at bare minimum, makes it possible that immaterial entities exist.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.,7,Con,"              The experience does not vindicate or support the explanation the person assumes.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.,8,Con,"                The experience could be an incorrigible truth [4] that can't be expressed to others in terms they can understand until they experience it for themselves.
",4,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.,9,Con,"                  Without doubting the truth of the experience, one can still discard the explanation.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.1.1.1.1.,10,Con,"                    If the set of spiritual experiences was small, then it would be more warranted to believe that these spritual experiences weren’t possible. However, we have billions of people testifying to these experiences. Such a large set drastically increases the probability that there can be authentic expreiences with a spiritual world. Thus, it is possible (if not probable) that the spiritual world exists.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.2.,7,Con,"              Culturally specific explanations assigned to these experiences suggests the explanations are not verified by the experience.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.2.1.,8,Con,"                It is likely that cultural explanations do explain some or even many of these religious experiences. However, to assume this was necessarily true for all would be an unwarranted assumption.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.,7,Con,"              Non religious people have similar experiences without a God based explanation.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.,8,Con,"                This assumes the experiences of non-religious people are similar to those who believe in the spiritual based on experience. This is an unwarranted assumption.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.,9,Con,"                  No true Scotsman fallacy/special pleading. The descriptions are so similar that there is no reason to think they are different. All the ancient religions have spiritual experiences, as do most modern cults. The only difference is cultural interpretation.

",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.,11,Con,"                      Without a definitive and objective way to distinguish between a spurious claim and a genuine godly experience the grandparent claim of using the no true Scotsman fallacy holds. The parent claim still suggests that some supposed godly experiences are real and others are false without presenting an objective way to distinguish them.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1.,12,Con,"                        This whole chain is about establishing personal warrant for believing in God. Therefore, the parent fails to distinguish between epistemological and metaphysical claims. There is a difference between knowing something to be true and showing something to be true. The primary purpose of these claims is to demonstrate that belief in God is rational and there is no epistemological objection to that can dismiss it.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.1.1.2.,10,Con,"                    **In fact, non-Christian religious experience, such as Buddhist or Hindu religious experience, is typically very different from Christian experience. There is no reason to think that non-veridical religious experiences are indistinguishable from the witness of the Holy Spirit.

It would seem that ascribing some of these experiences as real and some as false is an entirely subjective activity. Additionally they might say the very same thing about your experience.

1.1.1.2.2.1.2.3.2.,8,Con,"                Religious experiences (even false ones) aren't simply spurious.

1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.,8,Pro,"                Theists' ""god-detection"" sense is prone to so many false positives that it's useless as a test.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1.,9,Con,"                  Even if this is true for some individuals, it doesn’t follow that it is true for all personal experiences of God.
",,
1.1.1.2.2.1.2.4.1.1.1.,10,Con,"                    Any alleged personal experience of God is more simply explained or interpreted in a way that does not imply the existence of a God or other supernatural entity. That is, it can be explained or interpreted in a naturalistic way. As a natural explanation/interpretation is always simpler (assumes less) than a supernatural explanation/interpretation, such an experience cannot serve as a reason to believe the supernatural.
