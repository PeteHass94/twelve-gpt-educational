"Here are some arguments in support of the thesis: The right thing to do is to pull the lever, diverting the trolley [1] onto the side track where it will kill one person.
. 

   It is better to pull the lever because five lives are worth more than one from a utilitarian perspective.
.   Pulling the lever is the right thing to do because a world where people are willing to sacrifice one person to save five is a better world to live in.
.     There is more suffering and pain if more people die.
.     Saving a greater number of people is likely to produce greater amounts of total utility in the long-term.
.     The highest good is human happiness [48]. Therefore, the goal of any decision should be to maximize happiness.
.     As people have a greater probability of ending up on the main track, they are more likely to agree that the switch should be thrown.
.     A world where people are willing to act to help others would be better than one where they are happy to sit by and allow harm to be caused.";"Pulling the lever and diverting the trolley to the side track where it will kill one person is the right thing to do because it is the most effective way to minimize the total number of deaths. Saving five lives instead of one is a simple mathematics problem. It is always better to minimize the number of potential deaths by diverting the trolley and saving as many lives as possible, which is a fundamental principle of the duty to prevent harm."," It is ethically correct to minimize the number of deaths caused due to the accident, and the option that saves more lives is the right decision. A situation where people are more likely to act to help others in emergencies is much preferable rather than a world where they are willing to sit back and allow harm to be caused, making it morally correct to pull the lever to minimize the damage caused by the accident."
